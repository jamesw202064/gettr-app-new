It has been one year since October 14, 2020, the day the New York Post [broke the explosive story](https://nypost.com/2020/10/14/email-reveals-how-hunter-biden-introduced-ukrainian-biz-man-to-dad/) about the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop, revealing the depths of his sketchy foreign business dealings and his practice of trading on his father’s name and power. Emails and other information contained on the laptop also potentially implicated his father, now-President Joe Biden, as possibly having known of, approved of, and benefited personally from those schemes.

As soon as the New York Post dropped the bombshell, the Silicon Valley social media oligarchs shifted into censorship overdrive, preventing the posting or sharing of the story, with Twitter even suspending the Post’s official account as they demanded that the tweet promoting the story be deleted.

The broad suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story on social media gave cover to the corporate press to refuse to report on it during a crucial time in the 2020 presidential campaign, as the news had broken less than three weeks before Election Day. The actions of the social media giants and the corporate news media’s refusal to cover the story combined to keep the information from wide distribution to the American people.

Unfortunately for the nation, and sadly for 1st Amendment rights, the massive blackout of the Hunter Biden laptop story worked. Post-election polls showed that a significant number of Biden voters [would have changed their votes](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/medias-hiding-of-hunter-biden-scandal-robbed-trump-of-clear-win-poll) if they had known about it beforehand, easily enough to award a clear victory to President Donald Trump in key states.

Now, a year later, and a year too late, the Post’s reporting has been [vindicated](https://nypost.com/2021/10/12/one-year-later-the-posts-hunter-biden-reporting-is-vindicated-but-still-buried/) – never debunked – and even [confirmed](https://www.foxnews.com/media/politico-hunter-biden-laptop-story-russian-disinformation) by other news outlets.

Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GETTR, the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, today issued the following statement:

> “The Hunter Biden laptop story crystalized everything that’s wrong with the Big Tech oligarchs – they have too much power, they control the flow of information, and they tip the scales in favor of the ideology they prefer. This isn’t a secret. Everyone knows it’s true.
>
> “What the Silicon Valley billionaires did in the closing weeks of the 2020 presidential campaign was nothing short of election interference, as they ran cover for the candidate of their choice and made it easier for most of the national news media to ignore a story that would have harmed Joe Biden.
>
> “This brazen censorship is what created the need for GETTR and we have stepped forward to give voice to people who feel silenced by social media. No one will be canceled on GETTR for their political opinions, and we welcome differing points of view – unlike other platforms which will stamp out independent thought if it upsets the ‘approved’ narrative.
>
> “Today is a grim reminder of the damage that unchecked power can inflict, so everyone should observe the Hunter Biden Laptop-iversary by opening an account on GETTR today.”
