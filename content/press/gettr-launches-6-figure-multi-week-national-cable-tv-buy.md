[GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, is launching a six-figure, multi-week national cable television ad buy to spread the word about the fastest-growing social media phenomenon in history. GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said the national advertising would begin on Newsmax and the One America News Network.

“The organic and word-of-mouth response has been fantastic, and we want to make sure even more people know about GETTR as the marketplace of ideas,” Miller said. “People are fed up with the Silicon Valley oligarchs telling them what they can and can’t say, so GETTR is offering a place where the 1st Amendment is truly respected.”

The video spot is just the latest in GETTR’s creative marketing strategies. The platform has advertised extensively online, including “taking over” the Drudge Report twice. GETTR has also flown aerial banners above major events, like college football games, NASCAR races, and rallies held by former President Donald Trump.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already is approaching three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
