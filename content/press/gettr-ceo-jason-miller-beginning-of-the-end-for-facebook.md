**The disastrous week for tech giant Facebook marks the “beginning of the end,” according to Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GETTR, the new social media platform which opposes cancel culture and fights for free speech. Miller appeared on Fox Business’ “Mornings with Maria” Friday just as Time Magazine posed the question of whether it is time to** [**Delete ‘Facebook’?**](https://time.com/6104863/facebook-regulation-roger-mcnamee/)**”**

**Facebook suffered twin catastrophes this week, first with a six-hour outage across all its platforms on Monday and then with a riveting Senate hearing Tuesday featuring a liberal whistleblower who revealed the company’s efforts to attract and addict small children to their products.**

**“This is very similar to the Goths sacking Rome. I think this is the beginning of the end for Facebook,” Miller told host Maria Bartiromo. “Really, two big, buried leads from this week. One, that you have the far left, as in the whistleblower, starting to take on Big Tech – something we’ve seen from the more right-of-center space. But then also, Maria, most people didn’t realize the consolidation of Big Tech and their control over your data. With Facebook owning Instagram, owning WhatsApp, of course with Facebook Messenger. As the system went down this week, people started to realize, ‘Wait a minute, one simple server upgrade, one system-wide upgrade, led to all this shutting down?’ Two percent drop in the NASDAQ. It’s really concerning that one person and one company controls so much.”**
