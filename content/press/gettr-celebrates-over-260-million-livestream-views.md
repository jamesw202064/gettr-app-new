Free speech social media platform GETTR has recorded 260 million livestream views since launching the technology last October – a milestone which firmly establishes the company as one of the world’s fastest-growing destinations for uncensored content.

The number is a remarkable achievement for a company that officially entered the market just over one year ago in July 2021, and shows that audiences are seeking alternatives in the face of rampant censorship and unjustified bans on Google-owned YouTube and Chinese Communist Party-influenced TikTok.

GETTR today boasts an almost 24/7 live roster of livestreams from around the world and will be the only place to see unparalleled live and unrestricted behind-the-scenes content for the upcoming U.S. midterm elections.

“GETTR is rapidly becoming the world’s leading destination for video content that is open, unrestricted, noisy and fun,” GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said. “While our competitors busy themselves with censoring and stifling political debate, we are committed to fostering a healthy exchange of ideas – the way the internet was originally intended, and becoming the platform of choice for political analysis, must-see interviews and entertainment.”

For example, over the last week GETTR broadcast the first live run-off debate between Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and political opponent Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a political discussion between Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake and senate candidate Blake Masters, as well as protests over the cost of living crisis in Germany.

This week, GETTR will livestream the Illinois gubernatorial debate, President Joe Biden’s rally with Democratic senate candidate John Fetterman, as well as a live Q&A with Tommy Wiseau, the director of legendary film “The Room,” on Friday.

Livestreaming on GETTR allows content creators and regular users to broadcast live video and interact with a community without the threat of shadow banning or political censorship that exists on larger platforms like YouTube. GETTR will soon announce new features which will allow content creators to monetize and be paid fairly for their work.

Today, GETTR has more than 6.5 million users in 192 countries and remains the fastest growing social media network in history.
