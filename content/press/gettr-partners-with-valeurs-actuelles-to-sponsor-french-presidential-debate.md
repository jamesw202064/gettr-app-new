Free speech platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848) has proudly partnered with French conservative magazine [Valeurs actuelles](https://www.valeursactuelles.com/) to be the main sponsor of the “Grand Debate of Values,” their big presidential debate ahead of the French election.  
  
GETTR will exclusively live-stream the full event from The Dome of Paris on Tuesday, March 22nd, which will see French presidential candidates Eric Zemmour and Valérie Pécresse take the stage along with Jordan Bardella, the National Rally Spokesman. This event will also feature Marlène Schiappa, the Delegate Minister of Citizenship, representing the current President and candidate for reelection, Emmanuel Macron, as well as Eric Ciotti, supporter of Valérie Pécresse. Finally, Marion Marechal, who joined Eric Zemmour, will close out the evening.  
  
GETTR founder and chief executive officer Jason Miller, who earlier this month decried [Twitter’s unwarranted suspension](https://about.gettr.com/press/la-suspension-des-comptes-de-campagne-de-zemmour-et-le-pen-par-twitter-est-iindication-indeniable-dune-censure-politique) of dozens of accounts associated with Le Pen and Zemmour’s campaigns, will be in Paris to attend the event.  
  
“GETTR is proud to sponsor this debate which will ensure the people of France know exactly where every candidate stands ahead of the French presidential election. Big Tech companies driven by liberal ideology have already begun interfering in the democratic process, as we saw when Twitter suspended dozens of campaign accounts several weeks ago. GETTR is fighting for free speech wherever it is under threat from censorship, and will be the place for all the direct updates from the French campaign trail,” Miller said.  
  
“VA+ has been a victim of Big Tech censorship since its inception; Our development strategies have been severely disrupted and slowed down by the regular demonetization of our content, the fact that our Facebook pages came close to being taken down in 2021, and the removal of our million-view interview with Professor Peronne. GETTR offers us some hope as an alternative for informing our public without the fear of Big Tech’s control hanging over our heads,” explained Baudouin Wisselmann, director of VA+ at Valeurs actuelles.  
  
Today, GETTR has five million registered users. To name a few, journalists Elisabeth Levy, André Bercoff and Eric Morillot of course, lecturer and essayist Idriss Aberkane, lawyer Fabrice Di Vizio, actress Béatrice Rosen and politicians Eric Zemmour, candidate in the French presidential election, Jordan Bardella, President of the National Rally, Louis Aliot, Mayor of Perpignan, David Rachline, Mayor of Fréjus, Stéphane Ravier, Senator, Thierry Mariani, Virginie Joron or Jérôme Rivière, Members of the European Parliament, Florian Philippot, President of the Patriots, and many others, have joined the platform.  
  
GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
