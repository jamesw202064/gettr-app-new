Silicon Valley billionaires are dictating the terms of free speech for people across the entire planet, posing a grave threat to freedom of expression, said Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of the new “cancel free” social media platform GETTR, in a new interview. In a conversation with Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter of [Ami Magazine,](https://www.amimagazine.org/2021/09/15/catching-up-with-jason-miller/) Miller also discussed his experiences with President Donald Trump on both of his campaigns and other thoughts about social media.

> Miller: That Twitter was able to deplatform a former president is probably one of the most outrageous things Big Tech has done in our lifetime.
>
> The fact that Twitter still allows the Taliban—these terrorist and murderous thugs—on their platform but kicks off President Donald J. Trump… There’s something wrong as a society when you start doing something like that.
>
> Ami: I guess the reason is politics.
>
> Miller: That’s exactly what it is.
>
> Ami: But you’re pointing out that it’s hypocrisy.
>
> Miller: Yes, and it’s also because the Big Tech social media oligarchs are trying to frame the world in accordance with their vision. In effect, there are three billionaires in California who are dictating the terms of free speech not just for the US but around the world. I don’t know if you saw this in The New York Times, but Facebook recently launched an expanded advisory board to start looking at elections around the world, starting in places like Hungary, the Philippines and Brazil, with the specific goal of stopping “misinformation.” What this means is that if these countries have their own version of the Hunter laptop story, they can go and suppress it. They get to play judge, jury and executioner in deciding what’s information and what’s misinformation, and it’s coming to every other country in the world too. Just think about that. Three billionaires in Silicon Valley are determining the right to free speech for the entire planet. That’s kind of messed up, in my opinion.
