_All-In-One Free Speech Platform GETTR Catches Twitter Napping, Now Offering Edit Feature At No Cost_  
 

Social media platform GETTR today announced a massive user experience breakthrough with the addition of an edit feature for all posts. The feature will be available to all users - at no cost - regardless of platform verification status.  
   
GETTR’s new edit feature will allow users to make corrections to posts up to one hour after initial publication, and a single post can be edited up to five times. Twitter only allows users to edit a post within 30 minutes. The new feature functionality will allow GETTR users to see the original post _and_ the edited version, so context does not get lost. Additionally, analytics will also be provided for edited posts.  
   
GETTR’s new post editing feature is immediately available on desktop and Android devices and will be coming to iOS in the coming days.  
   
“In just over a year of existence, GETTR has done what 15-year-old Twitter has failed to do by adding an edit feature. Besides providing an inviting free speech environment safe from political discrimination, GETTR is not charging for the much-awaited edit feature, and it is available for all users worldwide,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.  
   
“GETTR believes that freedom of expression should be accessible to everyone, no matter their political perspective or the size of their pocketbook. Twitter’s decision to release the edit feature only in certain regions, and only to users of their ailing ‘Twitter Blue’ $4.99 paid service, shows that they have become social media dinosaurs. And like the dinosaurs, Twitter’s time has passed in the minds of millions of social media enthusiasts,” Miller added.  
   
Post editing is one of the latest user experience advancements for GETTR’s users. In addition to traditional Timeline micro-blogging, GETTR recently unveiled a massive upgrade for its in-app “Vision” short-video feature, and GETTR Livestreaming is bringing exclusive content with real-time subtitle translations to users globally, with over 200 million Livestream views to-date.  
   
Since the launch of GETTR on July 4, 2021, GETTR has become the fastest growing social media platform in history, reaching one million users in less than 3 days. By comparison, it took Twitter 24 months to reach one million users. Today GETTR hosts over 6 million users in 192 different countries worldwide.  
   
Some of the most notable GETTR user accounts include Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, British football commentator Matt Le Tissier, radio great and author Mark Levin, investigative journalist Andy Ngo, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and podcasting great Joe Rogan.
