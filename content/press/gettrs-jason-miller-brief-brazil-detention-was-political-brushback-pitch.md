Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GETTR, the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, told FoxNews.com that his brief detention in Brazil this week was a “political brushback pitch because we support free speech.”

Miller had traveled to Brazil over the weekend to speak at CPAC-Brasil, a gathering of major conservative figures from America and Brazil. At the airport on Tuesday as they were attempting to fly home to the United States, Miller and another member of his traveling party were detained for three hours for questioning. Authorities wanted to know, among other things, what they were doing in Brazil, who they worked for, who they met with, and who was helping them in Brazil. Miller declined to answer their questions and was subsequently allowed to depart.

The incident comes amid tensions between Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who supports free speech and has a GETTR account, and members of the Brazilian Supreme Court.
