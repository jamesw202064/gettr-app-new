_All-In-One Free Speech Platform Adds Short Video Feature To Micro-Blogging And Livestreaming Capabilities_ 

GETTR is today expanding beta testing of its latest feature Vision, a new short video feature which will give users and content creators a fun way to express themselves on the world’s fastest-growing free speech platform.  
  
Vision invites users to create and discover entertaining videos of up to 60 seconds with cutting-edge technology that will compete against Big Tech rivals TikTok and Instagram Reels, and give anyone the opportunity to record videos seen by the GETTR community and reach a global community without the threat of political censorship or shadowbanning.  
  
The technology includes a growing music library full of over 100,000 top hits, special effects and alternate reality filters, one-minute video recording, soundtrack editing, and other stickers and video editing enhancements. As of Monday, Vision will be available to all GETTR users who download the latest version of the app.  
  
“Vision announces GETTR’s arrival as a tech company which can go toe-to-toe with the Big Tech dinosaurs – and we’re only just getting started. This week, we’re also introducing 4K livestream for content creators, and later this summer we’ll have GETTR Pay, giving influencers a chance to be paid fairly for their work. Our goal is to become the ultimate all-in-one free speech platform, and we won’t rest until then,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.  
  
Today, GETTR has nearly 6 million registered users on every continent but Antartica, and is the fastest growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months and even Instagram still took 3 months.  
  
Since launching livestreaming technology on the site in October 2021, GETTR has also recorded more than 142 million views, cementing its dominance as the leading free speech platform which can compete with Silicon Valley alternatives like YouTube.
