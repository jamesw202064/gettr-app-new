“Today’s announcement that Elon Musk is abandoning his takeover of Twitter comes as no surprise to those of us who predicted the implosion for months. But the lasting result of the failed acquisition will be permanent, and Musk deserves credit for further exposing the incurable, rotting, politically discriminatory culture inside the Blue Bird.   
   
“Let’s not forget the freakout by Twitter employees at Musk’s takeover that was so severe the company had to put safeguards in place to prevent engineers from sabotaging the platform. Or the leaked videos of Twitter employees personally mocking Musk, and other employees joyously exclaiming, ‘we’re commie as f***.’ Other Twitter employees personally attacked Musk as being an ideological extremist who would empower disinformation, despite the fact he’s consistently voted Democratic.   
   
“And Musk’s supposed sin? He promised he would restore additional free speech rights on the platform. These are not the actions of a company concerned with free speech. The reality is, Twitter’s culture is broken and cannot be fixed.   
   
“Now is the time for Twitter users to declare their independence from Big Tech and seek out free speech alternatives like GETTR, where all users are treated equally, where the Twitter practices of shadowbanning and manipulating algorithms are prohibited, and where your political voice will never be censored.   
   
“GETTR, which celebrated its one-year anniversary on July 4th, is the only viable alternative to protect online freedom of expression. The company is still the fastest-growing social media platform in history and is today used in 192 different countries, and now features Direct Messages, Livestreaming, Vision - a short video alternative to TikTok and Instagram Reels - and a presence on both the Apple App and Google Play stores, which allows the platform to scale. We invite people from all backgrounds and of all beliefs to download the GETTR App, and see for yourself what the excitement is about!”
