Free speech social media platform GETTR is proud to announce a new partnership with independent journalist and New York Times best-selling author Andy Ngo which will see him produce exclusive content for the platform.  
  
Ngo, one of the world’s leading independent journalists covering topics related to American far-left violent extremism, will produce an exclusive weekly news show on GETTR called “Weekly Notice” which will allow Ngo to discuss his reporting and provide political commentary and analysis without the threat of censorship or shadow banning.  
  
“We are proud to be able to partner with a journalist as fearless as Andy Ngo and give him a platform where he can share his important reporting with GETTR’s millions of users across the world. Journalism and free speech are both under attack from Big Tech censorship and a biased liberal media, and GETTR is committed to fighting for a space where important information and political debate can flow freely,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.  
  
“Those who have tried for years to silence me using violence, death threats, lawfare and censorship campaigns have failed and will continue to fail,” Ngo said. “I look forward to engaging with a new audience on GETTR.”  
  
Ngo is the author of New York Times best-selling book “Unmasked: Inside Antifa's Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy,” and survived a brutal assault by the group in 2019 and 2021 while reporting on the streets of his native Portland, Ore. Today, Ngo is the Editor-at-large for The Post Millennial.  
  
Today, GETTR has 5 million registered users across the globe, and is the fastest growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
