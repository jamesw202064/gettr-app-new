Free speech social media platform GETTR will be taking the United Kingdom by storm next week, hosting the first ever GETTR Comedy Night and a free GETTR World Cup viewing party in London!

The events are part of the platform’s continued expansion into sports and entertainment streaming opportunities, especially in the United Kingdom which is GETTR’s third largest market and has experienced 114% growth in 2022.

The festivities begin at [Comedy Unleashed](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/uk-usa-comedy-night-sponsored-by-gettr-tickets-459941636817) on Monday, Nov. 21 when several all-star comedians from the U.K. and U.S. go head-to-head in a no-holds-barred evening of laughter at the home of free-thinking comedy, starring Andrew Laurence, Dominic Frisby and Abi Roberts on the UK side, and SiriusXM host Tim Young representing the US.

  
The evening will also be Andrew Lawrence’s triumphant return to stage since he was canceled over a tweet in July 2021, and was forced to cancel a sold-out nine venue comedy tour.

The party continues on Friday, Nov. 25 with a special World Cup [viewing party](https://form.jotform.com/223104049834350) for the England vs. USA football match. Football legend and GETTR streaming star Matthew Le Tissier will provide exclusive pre-game and half-time commentary at London’s Cavendish Pub.

GETTR has become an active player in the fight for free speech in the United Kingdom, with its Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller penning multiple op-eds weighing in on policy issues such as the Online Safety Bill in both [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/04/20/orwellian-era-online-censorship-just-beginning/) and [The Express](https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/1640018/Boris-Johnson-new-Prime-Minister-online-safety-bill-Trump-adviser-Jason-Miller-comment).

“GETTR is making social media fun again and we encourage our growing U.K. family to join us as we take London by storm next week. For a long time, sports and comedy have been a way for people to come together regardless of their political views and at GETTR, we want to be a place where we can unite and express ourselves fully, without the threat of being censored or silenced,” GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said.

  
Big names on GETTR include Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell, podcasters Joe Rogan and Russell Brand, GB News presenters Neil Oliver, Dan Wootton, Nana Akua and Calvin Robinson, Mark Dolan, radio host and political commentator Maajid Nawaz, journalist Andy Ngo, football legend Matthew Le Tissier, singers Right Said Fred, rapper and author Zuby, publican Adam Brooks, presenter and restaurateur Tonia Buxton, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Free Speech Union founder Toby Young, writer James Delingpole, singer Gareth Icke, businessman Alan D Miller and ex-boxing champion Jamie Moore, plus many more.

GETTR is the world’s fastest-growing social media platform and hosts nearly 7 million users across 192 different countries. Since the release of livestreaming, there have been over 270 million livestream views, along with 40 million Vision views. Since its inception, GETTR has defied market trends and doubled its unique visit count in the last year.
