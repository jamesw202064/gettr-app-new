Twitter is a broken company with a culture so toxic, even an innovator like Elon Musk will have trouble making it a true free speech platform, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller warned in an op-ed [published](https://warroom.org/2022/04/25/not-even-elon-musk-can-fix-twitter/) Monday after Musk purchased the company.

The piece by Miller reads, in part:

_Elon Musk, the greatest innovator of our time, has reportedly closed the deal to take over Twitter, and any supporter of free speech should be cheering him on. But however the deal turns out, the reaction to it over the past two weeks has shown that Twitter is an ideologically discriminating cesspool of negativity, and whatever façade of independence, free-thinking, or commitment to free speech the company once had has been permanently washed away._

_This will be a long campaign even for Musk, a man who seems to know no limits, not just to finalize the finer points of the deal, but also to start the process of clearing out the woke warriors infesting the company._

_Recent Twitter employee statements online and in the media have made clear there’s no appetite to change the culture inside the company, and soon we will all quickly see there’s a big difference between controlling Twitter and controlling Twitter’s policies._

_***_

_Musk is realizing what we have known for years: Twitter is rotten to its core and cannot be repaired by simply tinkering at the margins. Twitter abuses its technology to discriminate against users instead of building a platform where free speech is respected and information and opinions flow both ways._

_It’s clear that if Twitter is to be a force for free speech again, it needs a wholesale tear-down to the foundation. Its leadership must be removed and the politically discriminating ideologues running day to day operations must be replaced. This would include programmers and nearly everyone else who works there – and that’s an incredible, if not impossible, undertaking._

_In short, Musk the innovator may find it easier to land a rocket on Mars than to change Twitter’s culture._
