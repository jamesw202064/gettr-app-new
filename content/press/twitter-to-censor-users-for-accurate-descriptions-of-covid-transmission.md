If you tweet – accurately – that people who have been fully vaccinated can still spread COVID-19, you may find your Twitter account suddenly locked or even permanently suspended. That’s the clear [declaration](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/medical-misinformation-policy) of a recent change to Twitter’s terms of service, [made quietly](https://www.mediaite.com/news/twitter-to-penalize-users-who-claim-vaccinated-people-can-spread-covid-19/) on December 2.

The new rules warn of sanctions against Twitter users who post “misleading information” about the virus, including “false or misleading claims that people who have received the vaccine can spread or shed the virus (or symptoms, or immunity) to unvaccinated people.”

These guidelines directly contradict a new study that shows that fully vaccinated people “[are just as likely to spread the delta variant](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-28/getting-vaccinated-doesn-t-stop-people-from-spreading-delta) of the virus to contacts in their household as those who have had shots.”

Additionally, The Atlantic [reported this month](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/fully-vaccinated-covid-isolation-breakthrough-transmission/620919/) that “A subset of vaccinated people will still push pathogenic particles out into the world; the chances of spread are lower, not zero.”

GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller today issued the following statement:

“Last time I checked, Twitter’s C-suite do not have degrees in virology, and they are not medical professionals - but they do have advanced degrees in political discrimination. Fact is, Twitter is more interested in protecting its chosen political narrative than they are in allowing people to have access to real information. If Twitter is actively encouraging people to believe that vaccines are more effective than they are, they are working against their own stated goal of protecting people and they are actually putting more people at risk.”

“This is one more reason why people are turning away from the social media oligarchs in droves. These Silicon Valley dictators don’t care about truth, they don’t care about public safety and they don’t care about spreading more information to more people. They only care about protecting their own worldview, limiting free speech and condescending to the masses, for whom they have undisguised contempt.”
