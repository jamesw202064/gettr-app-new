GETTR’s July 4 first anniversary was an action-packed celebration of freedom of expression, with more than 100,000 users tuning in to watch the platform’s star-studded live programming.  
   
GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller also announced the release of Direct Messages to all users which immediately saw nearly 400,000 updates to the GETTR app on the Google Play Store. Direct Messages are currently available on desktop and Android devices and will be available to iOS users next week.  
   
Famous names from around the world joined the GETTR Livestream to reflect on the company’s first year and the ongoing global fight for freedom of expression, including Brazilian politicians Eduardo Bolsonaro and ​​Carla Zambelli, French MEP Jérôme Rivière, German journalist Boris Reitschuster, political commentators Jack Posobiec and Dinesh D’Souza, UK football legend Matt Le Tissier, Brazilian YouTuber Gustavo Gayer, UK political commentator Maajid Nawaz, plus many more.  
   
“GETTR is truly the leading alternative free speech platform and I am so proud of the global community we have built over the last 12 months. With the introduction of Direct Messages on our site, we are one step closer to complete independence from the Silicon Valley social media oligarchs who treat users differently depending on their political beliefs. At GETTR, we welcome users from the left, from the right, the center, as well as those who don’t want to talk about politics at all,” Mr. Miller said.  
   
The celebrations will continue with GETTR’s first-anniversary party this Thursday, which will see GETTR employees and a star-studded lineup of key conservative influencers and allies gather to toast GETTR on the rooftop of its New York City headquarters. Five lucky GETTR users will also attend the celebration after winning an all-expenses-paid trip to New York.  
   
Today, GETTR has nearly 6 million registered users in every continent except Antarctica, and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.  
   
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at www.GETTR.com.
