New York, NY, January 26th – The fastest growing social media company in the world, GETTR,
launched a pilot program of the GETTR Coin Rewards Program to a select group of verified users.

The GETTR Coin Rewards Program allows a select group of users to receive GETTR Coins in their GETTR wallet as a reward for engaging in the GETTR platform.

At launch, the GETTR Coin can be sent between select users’ wallets only. Further functionality will be considered to drive engagement amongst users, encourage content creation, and incentivize content sharing on the GETTR platform.

The GETTR Coins can only be used within the GETTR platform by registered and verified GETTR users. The coins do not have monetary value and cannot be redeemed from the platform.

The current Pilot Program is in the technology and user testing stages. A platform-wide rollout will be contemplated once the Pilot Program has concluded.

We look forward to sharing updates on the GETTR Coin as and when they become available.
