Previewing the livestream video feature on [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform that fights cancel culture and defends free speech, Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller welcomed former President Donald Trump’s announcement of his own social media platform, predicted a bright future for GETTR, and teased a “counter conference” on freedom in London, England in December.

“We welcome more people jumping in. I think the real takeaway here is that Facebook and Twitter are dying. These are platforms that are boring, that nobody wants to go to anymore, and people are sick and tired of the social media oligarchs telling them what they can and can’t say,” Miller said. “This has never been just about one person. This isn’t about me. This isn’t about President Trump. This isn’t about any other single individual anywhere around the world. What this has always been about is our movement. And that’s really what GETTR is.”

In hosting his first livestream, a feature which will soon be available to all users, Miller also revealed other new technology which will be brought online in the coming months. GETTR will launch GVision, which will allow users to share short videos with their friends, and GETTR Pay, which will include cryptocurrency and real-time transactions for the digital economy.

“When I was still working for President Trump, as I saw this technology for the first time, I said, ‘This is it,’” Miller said. “This platform is about the future. This platform is about free speech. This platform is about all of us.”

Miller also teased a counter conference in the works in London on December 8, 2021.

“We’re going to be bringing together people from all across the world in defense of our civilization, our free speech rights, of technology, and everything that is so great,” Miller said.

As Miller wrapped up his livestream, he had one final thought for the GETTR community.

“Let’s go, Brandon,” he said.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already is approaching three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.

GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.gettr.com](https://email.press.gettr.com/c/eJyNkEtvhCAUhX8N7jR4AcGFi3lkFl120yXh5UiCjyjWzL8vY-006aoJIbnncD7g2IYCo7XOfAMYSiyAlRSLEoqyuNWE8ws-CcKBns4MUTzNblmKu4txLszYZ12DrWJCcEdYrYjQlFHOQVWCEy1YpeosNF2MEyInBLe0tm37zSNyW2Mve2f9moar65UPCKqnuIzrbFwSBxOk6qfg28dhmTQqfx-S-fPofGfKoNbBdG6R7Thb2cqSYXn3n05t6hUeh-iG-A3Odbee49u7bj-SLYfgbTL-iMsuGkpLRnWdK6yrnBqNc21bmoMVpVG1AGFoNjfR96mn4Adn53RxCGYv6vhAg_gZAaxrQgLspcB_wM_DcEl7fEzulTygxVEbIH79ApdyjeU).
