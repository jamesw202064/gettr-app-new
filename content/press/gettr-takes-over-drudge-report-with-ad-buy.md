[GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, today “took over” the Drudge Report, one of the top news websites in the world, with a significant advertising buy. The five-figure ad buy means GETTR’s message will be displayed for 24 hours on the Drudge Report, which receives tens of millions of page views each day. GETTR will also be taking over the site on Saturday for President Donald Trump’s rally in Des Moines, Iowa.

“With other Big Tech giants embroiled in bad news and systemwide meltdown, GETTR has had incredible growth in just the last few days,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “The Drudge Report changed the way people consume their news, just as GETTR is changing social media, so this is prime advertising real estate on the Internet. We want people to know: If you care about freedom on social media, you should open a GETTR account today.”

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already has amassed more than two million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
