Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GETTR, the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, today issued the following statement:

“You know that something has become a widespread phenomenon when they have to add a word to the dictionary to describe it. The social media oligarchs have targeted so many people for expressing their political opinions that they needed a way to define it. Call it deplatforming, censorship, or canceling, it all means the same thing – stomping on people’s right to free speech.

“At GETTR, we will never cancel someone for expressing their political beliefs. That’s exactly why GETTR has become the fastest-growing social media platform in history. We value the free exchange of ideas and are not afraid of competing points of view.”
