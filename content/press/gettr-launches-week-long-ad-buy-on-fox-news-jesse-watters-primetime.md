The free speech social media platform [GETTR](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=0d2a429a44&e=82ee8f8ec6) will launch a week-long ad buy on “Jesse Watters Primetime” on Fox News beginning Monday, February 21, 2022. The spot will air Monday through Friday in the 7:00 p.m. (EST) hour during Watters’ acclaimed new show and represents a buy of nearly six figures.

“Jesse Watters’ well-deserved show is the hot new thing on Fox News, just like GETTR is on social media,” said Jason Miller, GETTR’s Chief Executive Officer. “Jesse has been a vocal critic of cancel culture, which is perfect for GETTR, because your political opinions will never be censored or suppressed on our platform.”

GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months. Today, GETTR has nearly five million registered users.
