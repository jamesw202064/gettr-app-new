Football fans at college and NFL games will get an extra kick out of tailgating this weekend by looking up to the sky and seeing GETTR’s “Let’s Go Brandon” aerial banner. [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform which fights cancel culture and defends free speech, will again be advertising in the air this Saturday and Sunday.

“Joe Biden has had a rough time as president, and we want him to know that GETTR is thinking of him,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “GETTR is experiencing explosive growth and we want as many people as possible to know that we are the place to exercise free speech without fear of being canceled by Big Tech.”

Since August 21, 2021, GETTR has been flying similar aerial banners at football games, former President Donald Trump’s rallies, and the World Series, encouraging people to open accounts on the platform. GETTR even flew a banner in French (“ALLEZ BRANDON”) above a home game for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League.

This weekend’s GETTR banner schedule includes:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Saturday, November 6th | Missouri at Georgia |
|  | Tulsa at Cincinnati |
|  | Georgia Tech at Miami |
|  | LSU at Alabama |
| Sunday, November 7th | Buffalo at Jacksonville |
|  | Houston at Miami |
|  | Cleveland at Cincinnati |

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already is approaching three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.

GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.gettr.com](http://www.gettr.com/).
