A scathing new report from _The New York Times_ [published Monday](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/09/technology/meta-zuckerberg-metaverse.html) reveals how Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s failing Metaverse project is quickly becoming the laughing stock of the tech world -- with dozens of employees voicing concerns about his bizarre dystopian digital vision as Meta’s stock price craters and the company hemorrhages young audiences.  
   
Zuckerberg’s push for a utopian society, unveiled last year as the company rebranded to Meta, allows individuals to create alternate digital identities and is a giant step forward in the transhumanist movement allowing people to live forever -- and Meta’s employees are voicing their concerns.   
   
Despite pouring a reported $10 billion into the project, only 300,000 people use Horizon Worlds, the company’s flagship virtual reality game, each month, a tiny percentage of Facebook’s 2.9 billion monthly active users.  
   
“Mark Zuckerberg is embarking on a disastrous vanity project and has been reduced to begging his own employees to get on board with it,” said GETTR CEO Jason Miller. “He is spending cash like it's Monopoly money to stay relevant with the younger generation and in the process is driving his company into the ground. It’s clear that Facebook’s long reign as Big Tech bullies is coming to an end as more people abandon Meta. Now more than ever, we need a social media platform committed to free speech and things that are happening in the real world, and that platform is GETTR.”  
   
Here’s what _The New York Times_ has to say about the Metaverse:   
   
“...Meta executives have butted heads over the company’s metaverse strategy, with one senior leader complaining that the amount of money the company had spent on unproven projects made him ‘sick to my stomach.’”  
   
“In a May poll of 1,000 Meta employees conducted by Blind, an anonymous professional social network, only 58 percent said they understood the company’s metaverse strategy. Employees have also grumbled about the high turnover and frequent shuffling of employees as Mr. Zuckerberg’s priorities change. Inside Meta, two employees said, some workers now jokingly refer to key metaverse projects as M.M.H., an acronym for ‘make Mark happy.’”  
   
“Mr. Zuckerberg’s zeal for the metaverse has been met with skepticism by some Meta employees. This year, he urged teams to hold meetings inside Meta’s Horizon Workrooms app, which allows users to gather in virtual conference rooms. But many employees didn’t own V.R. headsets or hadn’t set them up yet, and had to scramble to buy and register devices before managers caught on, according to one person with knowledge of the events.”  
   
GETTR, the fastest growing social media platform in history, now boasts nearly 6.5 million users across the globe in 193 different countries. There have been over 244 million livestreaming views since the release of the feature 11 months ago, along with 39 million Vision views - the short video feature that is a direct competitor to Instagram Reels and TikTok.  
   
The platform proudly represents many high-profile users including British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, War Room host and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, author and journalist Naomi Wolf, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British football legend Matt Le Tissier, actress and former MMA fighter Gina Carano, Australian basketball legend and NBA Champion Andrew Bogut, and music stars Richard and Fred Fairbrass from Right Said Fred.
