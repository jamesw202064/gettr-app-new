In her White House briefing Tuesday, Jen Psaki, the press secretary to the President of the United States of America, called on social media platforms to do more to [censor content with which the Biden administration disagrees](https://www.dailywire.com/news/psaki-urges-spotify-to-take-more-action-against-joe-rogan?%3Futm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dwtwitter). The eruption of authoritarian rhetoric was in response to a question about [Spotify adding a warning label on COVID-related content](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/spotify-content-advisory-podcast-joe-rogan-neil-young-1292626/) like groundbreaking superstar Joe Rogan’s podcasts.

This is not the first time President Joe Biden has used the might of the Executive Branch of the federal government to stifle free speech, as the White House previously admitted that it has worked with Facebook to flag posts and accounts they deemed “[problematic.](https://nypost.com/2021/07/15/white-house-flagging-posts-for-facebook-to-censor-due-to-covid-19-misinformation/)”

Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of the free speech social media platform GETTR, today issued the following statement:

"Leftists who have cheered the crushing of free expression have always hidden behind the excuse that these social media oligarchs are private companies, and so they can do whatever they want. But when you have the White House putting pressure on companies to censor content they don’t like, that crosses the line into government-backed censorship.

"Over the course of the pandemic, people have been banned from social media platforms for expressing opinions about COVID that were called ‘misinformation’ at the time, but which we now know to be true. If you said the virus came from a lab in China, you’d get silenced. If you said you could still catch and spread the virus after being vaccinated, you’d get banned. If you said cloth masks didn’t work, you’d get the social media death penalty. All these things are now widely accepted as probably or definitely true.

"So, who gets to decide what’s ‘misinformation’? Jen Psaki? I don’t think so. At GETTR, we are the marketplace of ideas, and we will let people express their opinions and allow differing points of view to compete.”
