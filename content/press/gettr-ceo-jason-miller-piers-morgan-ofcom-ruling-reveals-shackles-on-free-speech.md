In a [new op-ed](https://bmmagazine.co.uk/opinion/piers-morgans-ofcom-ruling-is-a-victory-for-common-sense/) in Business Matters, the United Kingdom’s leading business magazine, Jason Miller – the Chief Executive Officer of new social media platform GETTR – argues that the Ofcom ruling on Piers Morgan actually shows how much free speech is being curtailed. Ofcom determined that Morgan was within his rights to express opinions critical of Meghan Markle, but that such a ruling even had to be made speaks volumes about the state of free expression today.

Miller’s new social media platform GETTR protects freedom of speech and does not “cancel” users for their political opinions.

The op-ed, which was published today in the midst of Miller’s visit to the U.K., reads, in part:

> _GETTR’s Jason Miller speaks out how left-liberal institutions have silenced us_

_A sign of how the world has changed over the past twenty years can be seen in the changed meaning of the word “controversial.” The term was once used positively to praise cutting-edge media that challenged us. Now it is a judgment wielded by the very same media to condemn policies or positions they disapprove of– that we’re all supposed to disapprove of. The same is true of the word liberal. Once used to describe a person willing to respect or appreciate ideas and actions that differed from their own, now it is the label of a person so intolerable that ideas with which they do not personally agree must be forbidden from the public dialogue._

_Today, everyone is at risk of being labelled controversial and illiberal hacks, masquerading as political progressives have made it their mission to issue as many scarlet letter “C’s” as possible. Whether you or cancelled or merely controversial, your views aren’t approved. Piers Morgan is no exception. A liberal in the true sense of the word, his brand is fire and brimstone, and he is unafraid to challenge the approved narrative. Hated and loved in both my home of the States and his native Britain, the recent ruling last week by UK regulatory board Ofcom sheds light on how far public freedom of expression has been curtailed._
