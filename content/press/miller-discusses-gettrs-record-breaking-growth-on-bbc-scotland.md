Social media users tired of political discrimination are fleeing sites like Twitter and Facebook in the millions to join alternative platforms which defend freedom of expression, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller told BBC Scotland as the social media company nears 5 million users worldwide.

Appearing live from BBC’s headquarters in London on Monday, Miller said that the recent entrance of President Donald Trump’s Truth Social to the social media landscape would see more users abandon sites like Facebook and Twitter.

“The difference here with Big Tech is that they're going in and saying ‘If we agree with you, you get free speech. If we don't agree with you, you don't.’ In my opinion, the merrier with this, and that's simply because Facebook is a dying platform. They lost users this past quarter for the first time ever. Twitter, as the Washington Post describes them, their business model is misery,” Miller said.

“Here's the detail a lot of folks in Scotland might not realize, when President Trump was de-platformed, about 20 to 25 percent of his voters in the United States quit social media. So as we joined the field with GETTR, and Truth Social comes online, we're seeing a lot of people come off the sidelines and join these alternative platforms,” he added.

Miller is currently in Europe as GETTR continues to explode both in the United States and internationally. Today, GETTR has nearly 5 million users on every continent but Antartica, with 46 percent based outside of the US, and is the fastest growing social media platform in history.

“With GETTR, which we launched this past July, we have already surged to 5 million users globally, which by the way, the fastest growing social media platform in history, fastest to 1, 2,3, 4, and now 5 million users. It shows that people are frustrated and upset with big tech and the political discrimination that’s picking winners and losers in the free speech debate,” he said.
