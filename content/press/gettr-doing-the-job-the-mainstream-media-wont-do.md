When thousands of patriotic Americans descended on Washington, D.C. last month to march peacefully against vaccine mandates, most of the corporate media refused to cover the event because it did not fit into their worldview. It was the same treatment the March for Life receives annually. But [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848), the free speech social media platform, has emerged as a place for people to get news about events that the mainstream media won’t touch.

 

GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller lays out the changing media landscape in a [new op-ed on Townhall.com](https://townhall.com/columnists/jasonmiller/2022/02/10/doing-the-job-the-mainstream-media-wont-do-n2603069):

 

"Thousands of patriotic Americans, including a famous actress from Marvel, descended on Washington to march peacefully against the increasingly rigid vaccine mandates that are seeping into schools and public life. Though polling shows roughly half of the American people oppose such mandates, coverage from left-wing media outlets (when there was any coverage at all) condescendingly mischaracterized the marchers as “anti-vaxxers” or “extremist” and “fringe” activists. 

 

"The same treatment happened with the March for Life in Washington the day before, and it’s happening now with the truckers protesting strict COVID policies in Canada. The mainstream media loves a good protest, as long as they are politically aligned with the goals of the protesters, otherwise, it’s covered as extreme or outlandish. If they don’t understand the protesters’ perspective, some newsrooms may not even find the protest newsworthy to begin with.

 

"This is the fundamental problem with modern mainstream journalism: the mainstream media covers events and decides what is news from only one perspective, and that’s theirs. Considering that the vast majority of American newsrooms are filled with left-leaning writers and run by left-leaning editors, this is a major problem for civil discourse in our democracy.”
