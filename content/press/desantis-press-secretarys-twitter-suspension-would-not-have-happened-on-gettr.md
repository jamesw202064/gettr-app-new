The Twitter suspension of Christina Pushaw, press secretary to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, would not have happened on GETTR, said Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of the new social media platform. Pushaw’s account was temporarily locked by Twitter in August after she forcefully defended Gov. DeSantis against a story published by the Associated Press.

In an [op-ed on BizPacReview.com](https://www.bizpacreview.com/2021/09/21/jason-miller-desantis-press-secretarys-twitter-suspension-would-not-have-happened-on-gettr-1137767/), Miller explained why GETTR, which protects free speech and fights cancel culture, would not have suspended Pushaw’s account:

> _If you don’t think that Big Tech and their media allies zero in on the conservatives they most despise, then you haven’t been paying attention to Florida over the past year. Sunshine State Gov. Ron DeSantis has been a favorite target of the corporate media for his method of handling the coronavirus pandemic, which has been to promote vaccines and acknowledge that Americans are inherently free people._
>
> _So, it was no surprise to see Silicon Valley giant Twitter in cahoots with the venerable Associated Press to attack DeSantis’ office over an issue that involved COVID and the attempted canceling of a conservative on social media._
>
> \***
>
> _When Pushaw took to Twitter to defend her boss, she was doing her job and engaging in exactly the sort of thing that would be heralded on social media and allowed to trend on Twitter if she were a liberal Democrat._
>
> _So, what was her grave offense, warranting a trip to Twitter jail? Pushaw poked holes in the AP’s story and then asked her followers to “drag them,” a term defined by Urban Dictionary as meaning to, “roast someone very hard.”_
>
> \***
>
> _On GETTR, users engage in the marketplace of ideas, challenging Big Tech’s control on information sharing and the broader public discourse._
>
> _On GETTR, no one will be canceled for their political opinions, because we are not afraid of competing thoughts._
>
> _And on GETTR, Christina Pushaw would have been free to defend her boss without fear of suspension._
