GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller will visit Australia next week after downloads of the app surged by more than 10,000 percent in September.  
   
Mr. Miller will conduct a three-city tour with former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage before speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Sydney next week. GETTR is a major sponsor of Farage’s speaking tour.  
   
Use of GETTR in Australia soared by 10,000 percent in September, catapulting the country to GETTR’s seventh largest userbase, up from 10, driven by the addition of Farage and former professional fighters Andrew and Tristan Tate to the platform.  
   
In an interview with [The Daily Telegraph](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/former-donald-trump-adviser-jason-miller-and-nigel-farage-spread-free-speech-movement-in-australia/news-story/38477ae20a7e27402323c982440065f1) on Friday, Miller said Australia was the next flashpoint in the fight for liberty and free speech.  
   
“Two things have made me pay more attention to Australia politically than any other time,” Mr Miller said. “The rather draconian Covid lockdowns; just the bars, restaurants and small businesses absolutely crushed. But then the commonality in standing up to the rising threat of China.”  
   
“Australians realized more than anyone, hey, this is the rising threat of the CCP \[Chinese Communist Party\]. You see it in Australia with the property acquisitions, with the business, moving in with that kind of soft power.”  
   
High profile Australians using the platform include former NBA player Andrew Bogut, New York Post columnist and bestselling author Miranda Devine, and Sky News Australia.  
   
Today, GETTR has over 6 million users in 192 different countries worldwide. Since launching on July 4, 2021, GETTR has become the fastest growing social media platform in history, reaching one million users in less than 3 days. By comparison, it took Twitter 24 months to reach one million users.  
   
The platform recently hit 250 million livestream views after launching the technology last October, and will soon announce major plans to allow content creators to monetize their work and keep more of their money.  
   
Some of the most notable GETTR user accounts include Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, feminist author Naomi Wolf, radio great and author Mark Levin, investigative journalist Andy Ngo, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and podcasting great Joe Rogan.
