Free speech social media platform GETTR is proud to announce a new partnership with British political commentator and writer Dominique Samuels ([@DominiqueTaegon](https://gettr.com/user/dominiquetaegon)).

Samuels, one of the UK’s fastest-rising conservative voices, will produce exclusive videos, live-streams and other content on GETTR, without the threat of censorship or cancellation that is running rampant on Big Tech sites. She joins Maajid Nawaz as the second UK political pundit to pen an exclusive partnership deal with GETTR.

“We are thrilled to announce this deal with Dominique Samuels, someone who is quickly rising to become one of the UK’s leading conservative voices, and we think this partnership is a natural fit. It is our pleasure to be able to provide her with a platform where she can share her political analysis without the threat of being banned and silenced,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.

“The ability to question authority and disseminate ideas is the cornerstone of any thriving democracy and GETTR is proud to be at the forefront of that fight for free speech, wherever it is under threat,” Miller said.

“I am so excited to be working with GETTR in the fight for free speech. For too long now, there has been a complete monopoly on what we can see and say by Big Tech platforms like Twitter. GETTR is designed to counter that, and give an alternative choice,” said Dominique Samuels.

Tune into Samuels' GETTR account at 8pm GMT (3pm EST) for a live Q&A on the Russian-Ukraine conflict [here](https://gettr.com/user/dominiquetaegon).

GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history and has seen explosive 50 percent growth in 2022 following the addition of big names like football legend Matt Le Tissier, Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell, GB News presenter Neil Oliver, journalist Andy Ngo, podcaster Joe Rogan, rapper and author Zuby, publican Adam Brooks, presenter and restaurateur Tonia Buxton, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Free Speech Union founder Toby Young, writer James Delingpole, singer Gareth Icke, businessman Alan D Miller and ex-boxing champion Jamie Moore, among others.

The platform, which is committed to protecting political speech and taking on Big Tech censorship, is approaching 5 million users just seven months after its July 2021 launch.
