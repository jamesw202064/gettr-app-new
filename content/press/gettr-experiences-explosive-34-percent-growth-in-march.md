Free speech platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848) saw a 34 percent explosion in sign-ups from the beginning of March to the end of the month, even as the social media space grew more crowded. The increase was calculated by comparing the period of March 3 through March 16 with the span of March 17 through the end of the month.  
  
“Every day, people are reminded that the Silicon Valley oligarchs are enemies of free speech, and every day that’s good news for GETTR, since we are a platform dedicated to free expression,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer [Jason Miller](https://www.gettr.com/user/jasonmillerindc). “Our users know that they will not be censored or canceled because of their political opinions, and that appeals to people of all political persuasions.”  
  
The platform now has 5 million registered users globally and has already experienced stunning 50 percent growth in 2022.  
  
GETTR also offers some of the best features available among social media platforms, including Vision, a short video option currently in beta testing which will take on TikTok and Instagram. GETTR will soon be expanding access to live-streaming and launching encrypted direct messages, online appreciation and tipping for content creators, and a two-coin cryptocurrency-based payments system.  
  
“Users come to GETTR to experience what true free speech on social media is like, but they stay because the user experience is better,” Miller said. “Our technology is better, the engagement is higher, and people have more fun interacting with each other on GETTR.”  
  
GETTR recently has attracted some extremely high-profile accounts from around the world, including comedian [Russell Brand](https://www.gettr.com/user/rustyrockets), former NHL star [Sean Avery](https://www.gettr.com/user/imseanavery), French actress [Veronique Genest](https://gettr.com/user/veroniquegenest) (winner of the French Legion of Honor), former South Carolina Senator [Jim DeMint](https://www.gettr.com/user/JimDeMint), Texas Attorney General [Ken Paxton](https://www.gettr.com/user/kenpaxtontx), candidate for governor of Idaho [Janice McGeachin](https://www.gettr.com/user/janicemcgeachin), [Rep.

GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months. Today, GETTR has over five million registered users.  
  
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=d05707d8c7&e=82ee8f8ec6).
