There are just five days remaining in the Get Revvin’ sweepstakes, sponsored by [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, where one lucky winner will receive a 2021 Harley-Davidson® Road Glide® motorcycle. The contest entry period, announced on September 29th, will conclude on October 17th with the winner to be selected at random by an outside law firm. Contestants must have a registered GETTR account to enter and the winner will be publicly announced after the conclusion of the entry period.

Registered GETTR users can enter at [www.getrevvinsweeps.com](http://www.getrevvinsweeps.com/).

“These are two classic ways to express yourself – speak your mind on GETTR and cruise on a genuine Harley-Davidson,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “You can fight the social media oligarchs on GETTR and defy the establishment on your new Harley-Davidson.”

The Get Revvin’ sweepstakes follows on the heels of the wildly successful Get Truckin’ sweepstakes, in which Lakewood, New Jersey’s [Rafael Goldberg](https://www.gettr.com/post/pc02s5efcf) won a 2021 Ford® F-150®.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already has amassed more than two million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
