While in Sydney as a main speaker for the Australian Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), GETTR CEO Jason Miller issued warnings about the devastating implications TikTok will have on current and future generations.  
   
In an extensive interview with Daniel Teng with The Epoch Times last week, Miller explained how the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is using TikTok to vacuum up personal data and create intimate profiles on the platform’s billion users for geopolitical gain, following a string of news reports which revealed the company has intimate ties with China’s Communist government:    
   
“‘What it’s about is they’re going to know more about your mental makeup than you do, and that’s scary,’ he told The Epoch Times on Oct. 1”  
   
“He said that China-based companies, and by default the CCP, now have access to all user information, including credit card details and passwords, from apps like TikTok, and at the same time, will be conducting ‘psychographic analysis of an entire generation of people.’”  
   
“‘So, let’s say my oldest daughter is 13 and they start tracking her when she starts an account. A decade later, she’s going through college, they then have a decade of psychographic analysis data on someone they know,’ he said.”  
   
“He warned that this data will give the CCP insight into what younger generations in other countries think about issues like Taiwan...”  
   
“‘They will know what’s going to move public opinion in very short order,’ he said.”  
   
“‘Fast forward another 10 or 20 years, and say my daughter runs for office. Imagine the manipulative ability for them to have the psychographic analyses of an entire generation of political leaders and voters, not just in the United States, but around the world. They will know if you’re going to like, swipe up, left, or right, and what content you will react to, before even you do,” he added. “And think how they’re going to use that to manipulate other governments, people in other countries — and they’re just getting started.”
