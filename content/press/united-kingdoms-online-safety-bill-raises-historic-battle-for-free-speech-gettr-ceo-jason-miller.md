Free speech in the United Kingdom is under grave threat from Big Tech and its own conservative government, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller warned in a Telegraph UK op-ed [published Wednesday](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/04/20/orwellian-era-online-censorship-just-beginning/) ahead of a vote on the Online Safety Bill.  
  
Under the bill, Ofcom, the state broadcast regulator, will gain the power to push media companies and social media sites like GETTR to remove “offensive” content, and issue fines if they fail to do so – essentially gagging political free speech, satire and debate.  
  
“As if the tax hikes weren’t bad enough, the “Conservative” Party is mid-assault on another of its now forgotten core values: freedom of speech. Nadine Dorries [has pushed ahead](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/04/18/nadine-dorries-uk-must-become-safest-place-world-go-online/) with the dreaded Online Safety Bill (OSB) which, to be clear, will result in censorship,” Miller wrote.  
  
“The Tories have thus caved to the decade-long cacophony of intellectually dishonest Left-wing guff about hate speech, where strong words are seen to be no different to an act of violence,” he went on.  
  
“The result of their surrender? A bill that prioritises cosmopolitan sensibilities over the right to offend or even challenge the status quo. A bill that intensifies state control over British media. A bill that is a boon for the Silicon Valley giants and their power-drunk yearning to shut down debate and silence the voices they disagree with.”
