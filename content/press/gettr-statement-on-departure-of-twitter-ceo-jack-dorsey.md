Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey has announced he is stepping away from the company effective immediately, following unrest over his leadership. Jason Miller, CEO of GETTR, the free speech social media platform which fights cancel culture, today issued the following statement:

“As the CEO of a social media startup, I know how difficult it is to run the company day-to-day. It must be even harder when you’re always trying to find new ways to trample freedom of speech. But for years, Jack Dorsey has been the master of multitasking: censoring opinions he doesn’t like, canceling users, silencing one of America’s oldest newspapers, and unfairly influencing a presidential election.

“Dorsey’s strangling of free expression is why GETTR needs to exist, and for that I suppose we should all be grateful. Without the crushing oppression and virtue signaling of the Big Tech oligarchs, millions of people from around the world wouldn’t be searching for a new social media home. Unlike Dorsey, GETTR is here to stay, and we will always protect the rights of people to speak their minds.”
