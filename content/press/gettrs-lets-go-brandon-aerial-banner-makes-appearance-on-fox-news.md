Aerial advertising by [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, was featured on Fox News during a story Tuesday about rampant stadium chants mocking President Joe Biden. Anchor Harris Faulkner showed video that specifically highlighted GETTR’s banner flying over the Georgia-Auburn football game on October 9, 2021, reading, “[LET’S GO BRANDON! JOIN GETTR.COM!](https://www.gettr.com/post/pdy4wxdbf4)”

The phrase “Let’s go, Brandon!” has quickly become popular on social media as yet another way to deride Biden and is the result of NBC’s interview of NASCAR driver Brandon Brown following his win at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama on October 9. As has been occurring at stadiums across the country, fans were chanting “F*** Joe Biden!” during the live televised interview. Knowing that the television audience could clearly hear the chant, NBC Reporter Kelli Stavast incredibly misdescribed the crowd as cheering for Brown, wrongly explaining that the fans were saying, “Let’s go, Brandon!”

In that moment, an Internet sensation, and a GETTR aerial banner, were born.

“NBC was caught embarrassingly trying to cover for Joe Biden, but it gave everyone a chance to have a little fun with it,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “The 1st Amendment gives Americans the right to express their opinions, and whether it’s ‘Let’s go, Brandon,’ or something else a little more colorful, GETTR is the place to exercise that right.”

GETTR has been flying aerial banners at President Donald Trump’s rallies and at college football games around the country for the past several weeks, encouraging people to open accounts on the platform.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already has amassed more than two million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.

GETTR is available in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1571619156) and the [Google Play App Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gettr.gettr), as well as online at [www.gettr.com](http://www.gettr.com/).
