GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller today issued the following statement regarding the failed Twitter takeover by Elon Musk:  
  
“We knew Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter was a deal that was destined to fail. Twitter has shown its hand – it is a fundamentally broken product that has sold out to the far-left agenda of controlling online speech. Musk’s attempt to restore freedom of speech to Twitter was the platform’s last hope to remain a relevant social media site. However, the corruption and censorship ran too deep into every fiber of the company – from the CEO down to the junior staffers– and it has become clear that Twitter is more interested in being a platform that manipulates and controls ‘what’s happening’ rather than being a ‘public town square.’  
   
“Whether it be Twitter’s crumbling share price or the nasty court case that is brewing between Musk and Twitter, things are undoubtedly about to get worse for the Big Tech social media oligarchs. The Blue Bird is past the point of redemption.  
   
“As Twitter continues to spiral down the drain, now is the time for the great migration over to GETTR. GETTR is the only social media platform that will survive in the long run, and in less than a year, has become the all-in-one free speech platform. From longer posts, Livestreaming, Direct Messaging, and Vision – our competitor to Tik Tok and Instagram Reels - GETTR is the one-stop-shop for content creators and everyday people to express themselves without the fear of online censorship, no matter their political beliefs.”  
   
After celebrating its one-year anniversary on July 4th, GETTR has some impressive statistics to tout, including:

* Nearly 6 million users worldwide
* 1.5 million monthly users
* 160 million Livestream views since the launch of Livestreaming in October 2021
* 72 million posts
* 3 million Vision views
* 192 countries using GETTR
