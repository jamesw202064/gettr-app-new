Once again this weekend, fans at college football games across the country will be able to look up and see a message from [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform which fights cancel culture and defends free speech. As has become custom, GETTR will by flying aerial banners with the message “LET’S GO BRANDON! JOIN GETTR.COM” at various NCAA football games on Saturday.

“The Biden White House may claim they don’t know what ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ means, but everyone else in America does, and GETTR wants people to know that we defend their right to say it,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “More and more people are turning their backs on the Silicon Valley social media giants, and GETTR is really the only true destination for those who want to express their opinions without fear of getting canceled by Big Tech.”

GETTR has been flying similar aerial banners at football games and former President Donald Trump’s rallies for the past several weeks, encouraging people to open accounts on the platform. GETTR even flew a banner in French (“ALLEZ BRANDON”) above a home game for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League.

This weekend’s GETTR banner schedule includes:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Saturday, October 30th | Georgia at Florida (in Jacksonville) |
|  | Ole Miss at Auburn |
|  | Texas Tech at Oklahoma |
|  | Kentucky at Mississippi State |

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already is approaching three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.

GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.gettr.com](http://www.gettr.com/).
