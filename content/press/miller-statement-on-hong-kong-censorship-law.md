Hong Kong authorities, under the complete control of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), have enacted a new law that permits the [censoring of any film](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hong-kong-passes-new-film-censorship-law-safeguard-national-security-rcna3989?utm_medium=email&utm_source=ncl_amplify&utm_campaign=20211101-miller_statement_on_hong_kong_censorship_law&utm_content=ncl-KaQZzFRnyb&_nlid=KaQZzFRnyb&_nsid=90d69c35-1aae-48d3-b7e4-9030c2615e47) that threatens the totalitarian regime’s grip on power. The law, which also allows the retroactive censoring of films that have previously been released, allows CCP agents to search movie theaters, company offices, or private clubs, and demand further information about individual screenings. Offenders can be fined or jailed.

Jason Miller, chief executive officer of GETTR, the new social media platform that fights cancel culture and defends free speech, today issued the following statement:

“This is just the latest incarnation of aggressive anti-speech attacks from the CCP, and it should chill anyone who cares about freedom. It would still be offensive if this were only being done by the Communist Chinese, but it’s scarily similar to censorship we’re seeing in all parts of the world.

“There’s no daylight between what the CCP is doing and what the Silicon Valley oligarchs have done to citizens worldwide on social media. If an idea is not ‘accepted,’ it is banned. The people who spread the idea are banned. People have their freedom taken away and lose their jobs. The enforcers may have different names, but the result is the same: the crippling of free speech. It’s why people from countries around the world are flocking to GETTR, where their voices can be heard."
