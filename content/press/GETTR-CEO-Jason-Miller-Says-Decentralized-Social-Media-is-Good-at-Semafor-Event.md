The proliferation of new social media platforms and the decentralization of audiences away from traditional Big Tech players is a good thing for free speech and choice, just as it was in the mainstream media, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said at a Semafor forum in Washington, D.C. on Friday.

"The way that you could have a couple of media outlets or a couple of social media outlets pick what stories are going to be covered or not, I think is bad for democracy," Miller said at a panel on news and democracy hosted by the breaking news start-up.

"I think decentralization giving people more options when it comes to free speech is a good thing."

From the downward spiral of Twitter, to the role of accuracy in media and how it pertains to democracy, Miller laid out the dire need for alternative social media platforms. 

“People are looking for new platforms, looking for new user experiences. I think for all the attention with Musk and with Twitter, I’m surprised, as an innovator, that he hasn’t spent more time on trying to improve the user experience,” Miller said.

“I think if Musk was putting his focus on innovation, there might be a chance, but I think the brand might be too badly damaged,” he added.
