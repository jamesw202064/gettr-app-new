[GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the free speech social media platform which fights cancel culture, welcomed 171,629 new users on Sunday – the biggest surge in single day signups since launching on July 4 – after podcaster [Joe Rogan](https://gettr.com/user/joerogan) and dozens of other big names joined the platform amid a fresh flurry of Big Tech censorship.

Activist [Andy Ngô](https://gettr.com/user/mrandyngo), political commentator [Dave Rubin](https://gettr.com/user/RubinReport), comedian [Larry the Cable Guy](https://gettr.com/user/gitrdonelarry), author [Dr. Jordan B Peterson](https://gettr.com/user/jordanbpeterson), columnists [Kurt Schlichter](https://gettr.com/user/kurtschlichter), [Karol Markowitz](https://gettr.com/user/karol), [Salena Zito](https://gettr.com/user/SalenaZito), and [Josh Hammer](https://gettr.com/user/josh_hammer), former NBA player and podcaster [Andrew Bogut](https://gettr.com/user/andrewbogut), British rapper [Zuby](https://gettr.com/user/zubymusic), UFC fighter [Tim Kennedy](https://gettr.com/user/timkennedymma) and MMA fighter [James Webb](https://gettr.com/user/jameswebbmma), and TV host [Jedediah Bila](https://gettr.com/user/jedediahbila) have also migrated to GETTR in recent days.

Rogan’s decision to join GETTR came on the same day Twitter permanently banned the personal account of U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), citing multiple violations of the social media giant's COVID-19 policies, and YouTube censored Rogan’s interview with Dr. Robert Malone, a contributor to mRNA vaccine technology who was also deplatformed by Twitter for his remarks on the COVID-19 vaccine, before joining GETTR on Dec. 29.

“Big Tech is censoring itself into irrelevance. It’s clear deplatforming President Trump was just the beginning in their war on free speech and now they’re coming for anyone who doesn’t conform to their worldview,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.

“The incredible growth we are experiencing at GETTR is proof that people are waking up to this dangerous reality and are hungry for an alternative which protects freedom of expression. Silicon Valley is officially on notice: GETTR is better!”

The tremendous increase in sign-ups was a 782% increase from Jan. 1 and a 1357% increase from the week before.

Rogan, the host of popular podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” announced he was joining GETTR on Sunday in his first post: “Just in case shit over at Twitter gets even dumber, I'm here now as well. Rejoice!”

GETTR was also trending on Twitter in the U.S., U.K., Australia and Canada on Sunday, reaching a peak of number six in the United States – the only topic in the top 10 that wasn’t related to the National Football League.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already has amassed close to three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever.
