More than half a million people joined free speech social media platform [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/) in the two days after podcast superstar [Joe Rogan](https://gettr.com/user/joerogan) announced that he had signed up, sending the total number of total registered users skyrocketing to nearly four million.

Rogan made his announcement on Sunday, January 2, which prompted more than 171,000 to open GETTR accounts that day. On Monday, that number almost doubled, with over 341,000 people opening accounts. As of Tuesday morning, there had been more than 545,000 new signups since Rogan’s declaration.

“This is the great disruption in the social media landscape,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer [Jason Miller](https://gettr.com/user/jasonmillerindc). “People have been looking for a new outlet for free expression, and GETTR is the destination. When Joe Rogan says that the establishment social media giants might get ‘even dumber,’ people listen and join the migration.”

The burst of new GETTR users is the biggest since the day of its official launch on July 4, 2021, and the platform is nearing four million total registered users.

Rogan’s decision to join GETTR came on the same day Twitter permanently banned the personal account of U.S. Representative [Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://gettr.com/user/mtg4america) (R-GA), citing her opinions as violations of the social media giant's COVID-19 policies, despite some of them being demonstrably true. Meanwhile, YouTube censored Rogan’s interview with [Dr. Robert Malone](https://gettr.com/user/rwmalonemd), a contributor to mRNA vaccine technology, who was also deplatformed by Twitter for his remarks on the COVID-19 vaccine, before he joined GETTR on December 29.

Rogan, the host of popular podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” announced he was joining GETTR on Sunday in his [first post](https://gettr.com/post/plg71j5d09): "Just in case shit over at Twitter gets even dumber, I'm here now as well. Rejoice!”

Rogan’s announcement triggered a flood of new signups from prominent figure and big names, including journalist [Mary Katherine Ham](https://www.gettr.com/user/mkhammer), [Newsmax](https://www.gettr.com/user/newsmax) host [Rob Schmitt](https://www.gettr.com/user/robschmitt), podcaster [Adam22](https://www.gettr.com/user/adam22), author and podcaster [Bret Weinstein](https://www.gettr.com/user/bretweinstein), commentator [CJ Pearson](https://www.gettr.com/user/thecjpearson), soccer star and announcer [Matt Le Tissier](https://www.gettr.com/user/mattletiss7), news outlet [The Daily Mail](https://www.gettr.com/user/DailyMail), and actress [Kristi Swanson](https://www.gettr.com/user/kristyswansonxo).

Others included activist and journalist [Andy Ngô](https://gettr.com/user/mrandyngo), political commentator [Dave Rubin](https://gettr.com/user/RubinReport), comedian [Larry the Cable Guy](https://gettr.com/user/gitrdonelarry), author [Dr. Jordan B Peterson](https://gettr.com/user/jordanbpeterson), columnists [Kurt Schlichter](https://gettr.com/user/kurtschlichter), [Karol Markowitz](https://gettr.com/user/karol), [Salena Zito](https://gettr.com/user/SalenaZito), and [Josh Hammer](https://gettr.com/user/josh_hammer), former NBA player and podcaster [Andrew Bogut](https://gettr.com/user/andrewbogut), British rapper [Zuby](https://gettr.com/user/zubymusic), UFC fighter [Tim Kennedy](https://gettr.com/user/timkennedymma), MMA fighter [James Webb](https://gettr.com/user/jameswebbmma), and TV host [Jedediah Bila](https://gettr.com/user/jedediahbila).

GETTR trended on Twitter in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada across the two-day period, reaching a peak of number six in the United States on Sunday – the only trending topic in the top 10 that wasn’t related to the National Football League.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th, 2021, achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.

GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.gettr.com](http://www.gettr.com/).
