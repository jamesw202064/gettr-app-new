Announcing his takeover bid of Twitter on Thursday morning, Elon Musk put in black and white what many people have known for years: Twitter’s politically-motivated management are trampling on free speech and democracy while driving the platform into the ground.  
  
Just days after rejecting his seat on the board, Musk delivered a brutal rebuke of the platform and its leaders, stating that Twitter does not serve the “societal imperative” of free speech and that its current structure and management need to go – otherwise he would need to reconsider his investment in Twitter.  
  
“It’s clear Twitter disrespected the world’s richest man, and he realizes that while Twitter’s technology is good, the people running it cannot be fixed. Musk has made clear that in order to be saved, Twitter needs a wholesale tear-down to the foundation, its leadership must be removed, and the politically discriminating ideologues running day to day operations must be replaced,” [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/52f0077f) CEO Jason Miller said Thursday.  
  
Barely a year after censoring the New York Post’s investigation into Hunter Biden’s overseas business dealings, Twitter recently launched another salvo of ideologically-motivated attacks on free speech, journalism and satire, unjustly silencing or banning numerous journalists, news organizations, elected officials, academics and political commentators for exercising their free speech rights.  
  
In an [exclusive livestream](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=8104a7ac6a&e=a9271237a5) on his GETTR profile Monday afternoon, Miller said the solution was more competition in the marketplace.  
  
“I think what Rumble is doing is great. Even other folks who are marketplace competitors of ours, whether we're talking about Truth Social or Parler, different people are coming up with alternative platforms to challenge the status quo, to take on this Big Tech political censorship orthodoxy. That is the way of the past. I think what GETTR and these new platforms are doing is challenging the orthodoxy and saying ‘We're going to give people a voice,’” he went on.  
  
GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months. Today, GETTR has over five million registered users.  
  
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](http://www.gettr.com/).
