Free speech social media platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848) will have extensive coverage of and reaction to President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday night, featuring live-streamed programming from Newsmax and a response from GETTR Chief Executive Officer [Jason Miller](https://www.gettr.com/user/jasonmillerindc) following Biden’s remarks. 

“GETTR will be the place to be to hear previews and analysis of Biden’s State of the Union speech, proving again that our platform is setting the standard for coverage of events as they happen,” Miller said. “And naturally, our millions of GETTR users will be able to express their own opinions of Biden’s speech, free from the censorship they would encounter on the Silicon Valley social media giants.”

GETTR began its programming in the afternoon Tuesday, with Director of Marketing and Engagement [Kaelan Dorr](https://www.gettr.com/user/kaelan) [live-streaming preview interviews](https://www.gettr.com/streaming/pxlmaz2f84) with Members of Congress from inside the U.S. Capitol. Dorr will also provide reaction from Members following Biden’s speech.

[Newsmax](https://www.gettr.com/user/newsmax) will live-stream its pre-speech programming beginning at 7:00 p.m. EST, carry Biden’s speech live, and continue with post-speech reaction.

Miller will live-stream his response to Biden’s speech, focused primarily on the implications of the administration’s policies for social media.

GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months. Today, GETTR has nearly five million registered users.

GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=d05707d8c7&e=82ee8f8ec6).
