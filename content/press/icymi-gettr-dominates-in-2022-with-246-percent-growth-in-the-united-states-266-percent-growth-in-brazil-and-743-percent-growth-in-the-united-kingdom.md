Additionally, GETTR went from strength-to-strength in its second year of existence, launching new features such as Direct Messages, an edit feature available for free for all users, “Vision,” GETTR’s short video alternative to TikTok and livestreaming real-time subtitle translations for seven different languages. 

GETTR has also created a global roster of around-the-clock exclusive livestreams, reaching 310 million livestream views since releasing the technology in October 2021, and 11 million Vision views since June 2022.
