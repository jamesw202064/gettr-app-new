GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller will be a guest speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Campinas, Brazil this Sunday, June 12.  
   
Users can tune into CPAC Brazil’s official GETTR account ([@CPACBRASIL](https://gettr.com/user/cpacbrasil)) where all of the speeches and behind the scenes action will be streamed live! GETTR’s own official Brasil page ([@GettrBrasilofc](https://gettr.com/user/gettrbrasilofc)) will also be a must-watch account this weekend.  
   
Brazil is GETTR’s second-largest country and represents approximately 14 percent of the free speech platform’s global user base, with more than 750,000 users in the country.  
   
Today, GETTR has more than 5.5 million registered users in every continent except Antarctica, and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.  
   
Organized by the Conservative-Liberal Institute, CPAC Brasil is now in its third year. For more information about CPAC Brasil 2022, or to watch the full event online, please visit the [official website](https://www.cpacbr.com.br/).
