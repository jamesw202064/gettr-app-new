_Fastest-growing social media company in history nears 6 million users globally_

Free speech social media platform GETTR will host a day of live programming to mark the company’s first anniversary since its founding on Independence Day 2021, with special shows, guests, global broadcasts, and exciting product announcements.  
  
GETTR CEO Jason Miller will be joined by the platform’s most famous faces to reflect on the company’s historic first year, which saw it become the fastest growing social media platform in history and surge to almost 6 million global users.  
  
GETTR’s senior engineers will also appear on July 4 to discuss what exciting new features the social media company will be announcing later in 2022, while GETTR’s international community will also join the live programming to discuss how the platform is so important for the global battle to defend freedom of expression.  
  
“It’s been a whirlwind first year for GETTR and our fight to protect free speech from Big Tech censorship and cancel culture is just getting started,” Mr. Miller said.  
  
“We have a passionate, global audience that is interested in fostering debate and dissent, not silencing it, and we hope that people from all political backgrounds will join our movement and tune in on July 4 to help us celebrate the first of many anniversaries at GETTR,” he added.  
  
Today, GETTR has more than 5.5 million registered users in every continent except Antarctica, and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.  
  
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=d05707d8c7&e=82ee8f8ec6).
