GETTR would like to congratulate Facebook following the company’s decision this week to redesign its home feed in a bid to stay relevant with a younger generation of social media users who are shunning Facebook for more content-focused sites like TikTok, Instagram, and GETTR.  
   
The introduction, which comes nearly 18 years after Facebook was created, updates the platform’s “discovery engine” to show users more videos and pictures from content creators and influencers rather than posts from family and friends.  
   
In June, GETTR announced it was launching Vision, its own short video technology to give users and content creators a fun way to express themselves. Vision has already hit more than 3 million views and saw a 52 percent increase in impressions during Turning Point’s Student Action Summit in Tampa this weekend.  
   
The feature strengthens GETTR’s status as both a content destination and the leading alternative platform to take on Big Tech just a year after its launch, with GETTR’s livestreaming technology also reaching 160 million views.  
   
“We’d like to congratulate Facebook for finally waking up and smelling the roses. Unfortunately, it’s too late. Users are leaving in droves and Mark Zuckerberg simply cannot afford to keep buying competitors in a bid to stay relevant,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.  
   
“After nearly two decades, Facebook’s long reign is over and it’s time for a younger crop of disruptive and innovative social media platforms to take over. With livestreaming technology, Vision, Direct Messages, and so much more, GETTR is the leading alternative to challenge the new Silicon Valley.”  
   
Today, GETTR boasts nearly 6 million users in 192 different countries. The platform, which defends freedom of expression from cancel culture and censorship, has reached 160 million livestream views since launching the technology in October, while Vision, GETTR’s short-video platform which launched in June to challenge TikTok and Instagram Reels, is at 3 million views and counting. Earlier this month, the platform also released Direct Message for all of its users.  
   
GETTR remains the fastest growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months and even Instagram still took 3 months.
