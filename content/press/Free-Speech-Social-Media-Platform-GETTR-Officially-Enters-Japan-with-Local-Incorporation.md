_Japan Entity Incorporation Expands APAC Business Development, Commitment; GETTR CEO Jason Miller to Visit Japan this Year_

GETTR, the social media company that fights cancel culture and defends freedom of speech online, is pleased to announce its official entry into the Japanese market with the establishment of GETTR JP GK, which recently completed its incorporation.  
   
With more than 6.5 million user accounts created globall, GETTR's entry into Japan is a strategic priority for the company's continued growth.  
   
Complete with full native Japanese-language support and a translation function that allows users in Japan to hear voices from all around the globe, GETTR maintains a strict moderation policy against illegal content but holds freedom of speech as its core value and does not engage in censoring its users' opinions.  
   
GETTR CEO and former senior Trump advisor Jason Miller will be in Japan later this year for media interviews and to meet with potential partners from the world of martial arts, sports, entertainment and politics, as more high-profile Japanese names join the growing list of celebrities making GETTR their platform of choice for sharing ideas freely.   
   
Mr. Miller will be in Japan at a time when more Japanese are looking to social media to discuss the issues that most affect them. GETTR is politically impartial but seeks to give users around the world an open, unbiased and uncensored online space within which to make their voices heard.  
   
“GETTR has seen explosive growth in 2022, especially overseas with half of our global community based outside of the United States,” said Jason Miller. “Japan has been one of our top markets from the start so it makes sense to make our presence official with this incorporation. I’m looking forward to meeting more users and partners in Japan as we continue to roll out new features and build our offering there.”  
   
Taking its name from a combination of the words "Get Together", GETTR attracted one million new users in less than three days after its launch on 4 July 2021, making it the fastest-growing social media platform in history. By comparison, it took Twitter 24 months and Facebook 10 months to attract one million users.  
   
GETTR has also reached more than 250 million livestream views since launching its livestreaming technology last October. Embedded within the app and offering live translation, GETTR livestreaming is another feature with exciting growth potential among Japanese users.  
   
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.gettr.com](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgettr.us5.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3Dba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9%26id%3De0d44ba5ae%26e%3De9ec71aa82&data=05%7C01%7Cebonyb%40gettr.com%7Cdf4285611cd9432f41c408daaada1a38%7C28bd1cc1db844a90b436b0d2c8c5771a%7C1%7C0%7C638010150988059397%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=6pD52JdfYjs3%2FLhNWPGGZM2hJIx3%2BWRPhh4rF9VbXDM%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=e0d44ba5ae&e=e9ec71aa82.
