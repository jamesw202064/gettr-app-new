Social media platform GETTR will make its formal entrance into Asia this week with a weeklong tour of Japan that will see Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller deliver a keynote speech at CPAC on the importance of free speech at a time when neighboring China is being roiled by anti-censorship demonstrations. 

The trip comes after numerous examples of Big Tech social media platforms inserting themselves into the matter of Taiwanese sovereignty from China, removing multiple Japanese videos discussing Taiwan as its own country.

Miller will travel to conduct media interviews and meet with potential partners from the world of sports, entertainment, and politics at a time when more Japanese are looking to social media to discuss the issues that most affect them. 

GETTR officially entered the Japanese market when it incorporated locally in October 2022 with the creation of GETTR JP GK, a Japanese business entity, and has seen a 31% increase of new active users from the country this year. 

Miller will speak at CPAC Japan on Saturday, December 3. GETTR has also signed on as an official sponsor of the event. Taking the stage at 1:50PM JCST, Miller will speak on the importance of supporting protests against the Chinese Communist Party’s draconian COVID-19 lockdowns and Big Tech-enabled state censorship.

There will be exclusive behind the scenes footage on the official GETTR Japan (@[GETTRJP](https://gettr.com/user/GETTRJP)) account and Jason Miller (@[JasonMillerinDC](https://gettr.com/user/JasonMillerinDC)).

“GETTR won’t stop until we have reached every corner of the globe with our promise to defend online expression, which is why we are going to meet the patriots of Japan and are showcasing our commitment to the region with CPAC Japan, our first event in Asia,” Miller said.

“I am looking forward to speaking with government officials, everyday users, and free speech advocates about the fight against censorship which is currently reaching a fever pitch in neighboring China. Our mission at GETTR is to fight for free speech wherever it is under threat,” he added.

GETTR today hosts over 7 million users worldwide. With a presence in 192 different countries, there have been nearly 300 million livestreaming views since the release of the feature and over 40 million Vision views. The platform has defied market trends, doubling its unique users in the first year of existence and plans to unveil plans for monetization in the coming weeks.
