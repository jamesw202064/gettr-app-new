The new social media platform [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/) has placed a week-long ad buy on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News, tapping into the massive audience for the top-rated primetime show on cable news. The buy began Monday night and will run through Friday’s show. At the same time, GETTR bought two weeks’ worth of ads, which also began Monday, on Fox Business Network’s Mornings with Maria show. The total ad buy for the two networks runs deep into six figures.

This comes two weeks after another significant buy that included Hannity on Fox News, as well as spots on Newsmax and One America News.

“Tucker Carlson’s gigantic audience is well aware of the fact that the social media oligarchs are trampling on free speech, and we want to make sure they know that GETTR is a place where their rights will be protected,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “And Maria Bartiromo certainly doesn’t back down from cancel culture, and neither does GETTR. In fact, fighting cancel culture is why we exist.”

The large ad buy is just the latest in GETTR’s expanding marketing strategies. The platform has advertised extensively online, including “taking over” the Drudge Report twice. GETTR has also flown aerial banners above major events, like college football games, NASCAR races, and rallies held by President Donald Trump.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already is approaching three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
