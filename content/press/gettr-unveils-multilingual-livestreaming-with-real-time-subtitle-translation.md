Global free speech platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848) is today announcing live subtitle translation on all streamed content on the site, allowing GETTR users to enjoy exclusive and politically-uncensored content from around the world.  
   
The closed caption technology provides live translation for 12 languages, including: American English, Arabic, Mandarin, French, German, Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.  
   
Since announcing its livestreaming feature in October, GETTR has become the destination for must-see video content including President Donald Trump’s rallies, updates from the French and Brazilian presidential elections, live footage from COVID-19 protests in Europe, and dozens of other exclusive political Q&As.  
   
“GETTR continues to innovate and bring amazing new features to our global free speech community. Our new translation technology will allow people to communicate better than ever before, without the threat of Big Tech censorship. We’re just getting started,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.  
   
Free speech advocates streaming on GETTR include independent journalist Andy Ngo, author Dinesh D’Souza, National Pulse Editor-in-Chief Raheem Kassam, House Republican Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Ca.), comedian Tim Young, football legend Matt Le Tissier, former Trump campaign advisor Steve Cortes, columnist Carrie Sheffield, British political commentators Maajid Nawaz and Dominique Samuels, Brazilian Federal Deputy Bia Kicis, French presidential candidate Florian Phillipot, bloggers Diamond and Silk, Turning Point USA spokeswoman Isabel Brown, and French journalist and "Les Incorrectibles" producer Eric Morillot.  
   
Media livestreaming on the platform include Newsmax, Real America’s Voice, Right Side Broadcasting Network, Steve Bannon’s War Room, French newspaper Valeurs Actuelles, radio hosts Bill Mitchell, Matt Couch, Todd Starnes, Matt Buff and Chris Berg, and podcaster Chase Geiser, to name a few.  
   
The new live translation feature cements GETTR’s place as the world’s leading free speech social media platform and comes ahead of several exciting new features in 2022, including Vision, a short video platform alternative to TikTok and Instagram Reels, encrypted direct messages, online appreciation and tipping for content creators, and GETTR Pay, a cryptocurrency-based payment system.  
   
The platform now has over 5 million registered users globally and has already experienced stunning 50 percent growth in 2022. GETTR is a truly global company, with over 60 percent of new signups coming from outside the United States.  
   
GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.  
   
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=d05707d8c7&e=82ee8f8ec6).
