Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of the new social media platform GETTR, which protects free speech and fights cancel culture, was a guest this week on The Spectator’s podcast Americano, hosted by Freddy Gray.

From [The Spectator](https://spectatorworld.com/radio/how-free-can-a-free-speech-platform-be/): “Conservatives often feel in the minority on social media. New social media platforms are beginning to emerge, however, that say they can better protect free speech online. Freddy Gray speaks to Jason Miller, CEO of the new social media platform GETTR, about what needs to be done differently, whether it’s possible to get a diversity of voices on a platform started on the right, and whether he would work for Donald Trump again.”
