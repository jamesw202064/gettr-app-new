GETTR, the fastest growing social media platform in history, is today announcing a partnership with Brazilian actress, television host, social media influencer, and entrepreneur Antônia Fontenelle ([@ladyfontenelle](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgettr.com%2Fuser%2Fladyfontenelle&data=05%7C01%7Ckingsley%40gettr.com%7C366f9398529f43c395ca08daa6fe7aa4%7C28bd1cc1db844a90b436b0d2c8c5771a%7C1%7C0%7C638005909181331503%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NddFr5Bk2Dodpya3%2BYUNdj8HhO4ReIOqGzXQ9hYnVhA%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://gettr.com/user/ladyfontenelle.

Under the new partnership, Fontenelle will create exclusive livestreams, posts, and interviews on GETTR. Fontenelle currently boasts 2.48 million subscribers on her YouTube Channel “Na Lata” and frequently hosts celebrities and politicians on the show. Her lustrous professional career will bring fresh, original opinions into the free speech realm on GETTR.      
 

“We are proud to announce our growing partnerships with influential patriots across the globe. Antônia Fontenelle will be an integral addition to our platform thanks to her extensive background in the entertainment and business industry. I am excited to see her bring new and necessary topics into the marketplace of ideas,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.    
 

“We are thrilled to provide Antônia and her millions of followers a place to come and discuss diverse themes without the dictators at Big Tech corporations snuffing out their right to online freedom of speech and opinion. As we continue to expand GETTR’s presence in Brazil, our second largest country, we will ensure that all voices are given a place to speak freely.”   
 

"Speaking your mind has a price. Silencing the world also has a price. Which do you want to pay?” said Fontenelle. “I prefer to pay the price of freedom, to shout when I'm being stepped on, to cry when I'm sad, and to laugh when I'm happy. Being real is for the strong. That is why I am 1000% GETTR!”  
 

GETTR, the fastest growing social media platform in history, now boasts nearly 6.5 million users across the globe in 193 different countries. There have been over 244 million livestreaming views since the release of the feature 11 months ago, along with 39 million Vision views - the short video feature that is a direct competitor to Instagram Reels and TikTok. GETTR also released a free edit feature for all users, beating Twitter’s paid capability.   
 

The platform proudly represents many high-profile users including British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, War Room host and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, author and journalist Naomi Wolf, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British football legend Matt Le Tissier, radio host and author Mark Levin, actress and former MMA fighter Gina Carano, Australian basketball legend and NBA Champion Andrew Bogut, and music stars Richard and Fred Fairbrass from Right Said Fred.
