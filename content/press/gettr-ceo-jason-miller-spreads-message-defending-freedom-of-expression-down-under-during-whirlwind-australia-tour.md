Freedom of opinion is a global concern and Australia is the next battleground for free speech and liberty, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller has warned during a whirlwind tour of the country which is soaring to become one of the social media platform’s largest user bases.  
   
“I had two real goals when I launched GETTR: one, to make sure that we offered a challenger social media platform, where there was no political discrimination,” he told Sky News host Andrew Bolt [on Monday](https://www.heraldsun.com.au/blogs/andrew-bolt/trumps-former-spokesman-says-free-speech-is-a-global-concern/video/744f3b5ffcf97f08eb3d3943919a0b69). “The second thing is I wanted to make sure this was a global platform: I didn’t want just an American echo chamber.”  
   
Miller is on a three-city tour of Australia with former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage as downloads of GETTR increase 10,000 percent in the country. Miller will speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Sydney on Sunday.  
   
In an interview with [The Daily Telegraph](https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/former-donald-trump-adviser-jason-miller-and-nigel-farage-spread-free-speech-movement-in-australia/news-story/38477ae20a7e27402323c982440065f1) on Friday, Miller said Australians were waking up to the trampling on their free speech rights during harsh COVID-19 lockdowns in the country, and the threat of the Chinese Communist Party.  
   
“Two things have made me pay more attention to Australia politically than any other time,” Mr Miller said. “The rather draconian Covid lockdowns; just the bars, restaurants and small businesses absolutely crushed. But then the commonality in standing up to the rising threat of China.”  
   
In an interview with [The Australian](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/extrump-adviser-jason-miller-spruiks-the-right-way-to-counter-big-tech-bias/news-story/dcf8f5865bd9baaffffab746f7b28173), the former senior advisor to President Donald Trump said many Australians were also becoming aware of left-leaning bias of tech giants like Twitter and Facebook and had been alarmed by the “authoritarian, draconian and socialist” nature of the Covid-19 lockdowns.  
   
When asked by Karl Stefanovic on Channel Nine’s [TODAY Show](https://gettr.com/post/p1sdfko17b9) if he would “ban raging lefties” from the platform, Miller said GETTR was for everyone, no matter their political views.  
   
“I want everybody on GETTR. In fact, I want the left, I want the right. Here’s the thing I didn’t quite realize when I launched GETTR last year: it’s not just about politics. There are people every day who get kicked get off of Facebook and Twitter every day who are like ‘I’m not even into politics.’”  
   
High profile Australians using the platform include former NBA player Andrew Bogut, New York Post columnist and bestselling author Miranda Devine, and Sky News Australia.  
   
Today, GETTR has over 6 million users in 192 different countries worldwide. Since launching on July 4, 2021, GETTR has become the fastest growing social media platform in history, reaching one million users in less than 3 days.  
   
The platform recently hit 250 million livestream views after launching the technology last October, and will soon announce major plans to allow content creators to monetize their work and keep more of their money.
