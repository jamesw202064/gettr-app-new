_Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court has issued orders to GETTR and other major social media platforms to ban the accounts of additional elected officials under threat of heavy penalties in a troubling attack on the freedom of speech._

Free speech social media platform GETTR has filed a second formal appeal with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) requesting the reconsideration of the court’s unjust demand to ban the GETTR accounts of Federal Deputies Bia Kicis and Cabo Junio Amaral.

Three Federal Deputies have now been banned from using GETTR by decisions of the TSE. In November, the TSE required GETTR to suspend Federal Deputy Carla Zambelli's account, threatening hourly fines and a complete platform suspension. The actions appear to be part of a worrisome new campaign to suffocate political dissent and freedom of expression in Brazil.

Monday’s TSE-ordered suspension, for which GETTR had only two hours to comply or risk an hourly - and shocking - R$100.000,00 ($19,000 USD) fine and the suspension of the platform in Brazil, is the latest of multiple such requests GETTR has received before and now after the presidential election. GETTR currently has almost 1.5 million users in Brazil, and the country is its second largest market.

GETTR's Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller issued the following statement on the court-ordered suspensions:

"These decisions make clear that a campaign is underway to suffocate political dissent and free speech in Brazil. We will again appeal for a reversal of these unjust demands by the TSE. Although GETTR always complies with local court rulings, we will not blindly roll over and accept these unjustified blanket orders, especially when no GETTR Terms of Service were violated.”

"GETTR will continue fighting against censorship and defending freedom of expression wherever it is threatened, including in Brazil,” he added.

GETTR has seen an enormous 500% increase in sign-ups from Brazil in the wake of October’s presidential election, leading to a 20% growth in its overall Brazilian user base. Today, GETTR is one of the world’s leading alternative social media platforms with more than 7 million users worldwide, and the platform defied market trends to double its unique user count in its first year.
