_Social media platform GETTR is calling on Telegram, Facebook, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to join their appeal with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) after they were ordered to remove accounts belonging to Carla Zambelli._

Free speech social media platform GETTR is calling on other social media networks to join their appeal with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) after the court this week ordered the immediate suspension of accounts belonging to Federal Deputy Carla Zambelli.

On November 1, the TSE ordered Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Telegram, TikTok, GETTR, WhatsApp and LinkedIn to immediately remove Zambelli’s profiles, or risk an hourly R$150.000,00 ($30,000 USD) fine and the suspension of their business operations in Brazil.

On Wednesday, GETTR’s Brazilian legal counsel filed a formal appeal asking the TSE to reconsider their ruling, calling it a burdensome and politically discriminating maneuver. GETTR’s legal counsel suggested it would be more appropriate for the court to suggest specific posts be removed if found to have violated Brazilian law. 

None of Deputy Zambelli’s posts have violated GETTR’s Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

In an interview with [Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2022/11/gettr-rede-popular-entre-bolsonaristas-recorre-contra-ordem-do-tse-para-bloquear-carla-zambelli.shtml) on Thursday, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said the network had a strong content moderation policy but decided to file a lawsuit appealing the TSE's decision on the grounds that it violates freedom of expression.

"But suspending the account of an elected politician, even more so soon after the election, when we need public debate for reconciliation and union of the country, is a violation of freedom of expression", he said. "This order is contrary to the notion of democracy, and brings Brazil closer to Venezuela and Cuba."

Downloads of GETTR have soared an incredible 500 percent in the days after the election, with top users on the platform including Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Federal Deputy for [São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Paulo_(state)) Eduardo Bolsonaro, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, politician Carlos Bolsonaro, singers Bella Falconi and Netinho, Jovem Pan commentator Zoe Martínez, Federal Deputy Bia Kicis, Pastor Davi Passamani and businessman Luciano Hang.

Today, GETTR is one of the world’s leading alternative social media platforms and defied market trends to double its unique users count in its first year. The platform has more than 6.5 million users in 192 countries and has recorded more than 260 million livestream views.
