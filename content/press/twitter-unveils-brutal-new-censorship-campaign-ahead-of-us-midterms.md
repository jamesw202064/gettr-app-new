In a repeat of their interference in the 2020 election, Twitter on Thursday announced a sweeping new set of Orwellian measures that will ratchet up censorship on the platform under the guise of “protecting” conversations during the US midterm elections.  
   
The updated [“Civic Integrity Policy”](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2022/-our-approach-to-the-2022-us-midterms) is the Silicon Valley giant’s harshest attack on freedom of expression yet and will see Twitter employees “prebunk” misleading narratives by “proactively” addressing topics they believe are allegedly subject to misinformation.  
   
And just as the company banned the sharing of the New York Post’s reporting into the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop ahead of the 2020 election – which was later proven to be real – Twitter will again squash the liking and sharing of tweets which they believe spread misleading information.  
   
“These disturbing new policies deliver a huge blow to democracy and free speech rights, not just in America, but around the world. We must not become numb to this kind of ideologically-motivated censorship which is a naked attempt from Twitter’s liberal executives to control the outcome of elections and the democratic process. Now more than ever, we need platforms like GETTR which have a firm commitment to protecting the public’s right to information online, no matter their political beliefs” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.  
   
Thursday’s announcement comes just weeks after fact-checkers at Facebook slapped a warning label on a prominent economist’s post asserting that the United States had entered a recession, giving it a “partly false” rating.  
   
Twitter celebrated the success of their censorship campaign on Thursday, asserting that their misleading information labels reduced engagement on certain tweets by up to 15 percent.  
   
The policies should raise questions about whether Twitter is still a social media company eligible for Section 230 immunity when its employees will soon be involved in proactively “prebunking” information.  
   
Since its formal launch of July 4, 2021, GETTR has become one of the world’s leading social media platforms, with a commitment to protecting freedom of expression and opinion from the growing threats of political censorship and cancel culture.  
   
Today, GETTR has 6 million users in 192 countries, with a 24/7 roster of Livestreams from across the globe that increasingly makes GETTR the platform of choice for political analysis, interviews and entertainment.
