GETTR is proud to announce a new partnership with author and Turning Point USA activist Isabel Brown which will see her become the platform’s first full-time livestreamer as the company prepares to announce plans to allow users to monetize their content.  
   
Brown, one of the country’s leading Gen Z conservative voices, will stream an exclusive nightly two-hour show covering politics, lifestyle, and cultural issues, without the threat of political censorship or cancellation. The first episode premieres on September 26 at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.  
   
The partnership with Brown deepens GETTR’s commitment to becoming a destination for must-watch video content. The platform recently recorded 244 million livestream views since launching the technology on the site last October, and will soon unveil plans to allow users to monetize on the platform.  
   
“I could not be more excited to take on a new role as a creator by signing on as GETTR’s first ever in-house full-time streamer! Digital content is changing before our eyes every day, and livestreaming is leading the way for the future. GETTR’s expanding livestreaming platform is gearing up to rival the biggest in the business and allows me to reach the next generation in an authentic, real way,” Brown said.  
   
“Especially in the age of digital censorship, I am so grateful to be partnering with a platform that’s empowering creators to truly speak their minds and challenge the narrative. Catch me streaming full time exclusively on GETTR starting September 26!” Brown added.  
   
Today, GETTR has over 6 million users in 192 different countries worldwide. Since launching on July 4, 2021, GETTR has become the fastest growing social media platform in history, reaching one million users in less than 3 days. By comparison, it took Twitter 24 months to reach one million users.  
   
“We are proud to partner with Isabel, a true free speech advocate who represents a new generation of online voices unafraid to speak their mind. Our partnership is just the beginning of a new chapter for GETTR which will see us go head-to-head with the likes of YouTube and even traditional media players,” GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said.  
   
Earlier this month, the platform unveiled an edit button for all users, in addition to a massive upgrade for its in-app “Vision” short-video feature, which has already hit 39 million views. Some of the most notable GETTR user accounts include Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, radio great and author Mark Levin, investigative journalist Andy Ngo, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and podcasting great Joe Rogan.
