GETTR is proud to announce British broadcaster and former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has joined the platform, capping off a huge week for the world’s fastest growing social media company.  
   
The partnership with Farage (@Nigel_Farage), a global heavyweight in conservative politics, will involve the production of exclusive video content, political analysis and sporting takes exclusively for GETTR users, cementing GETTR’s status as a leading destination for debate and discussion that transcends mainstream platforms which today stifle conversation.  
   
Today, Farage has over 3.2 million followers across all platforms and has become a TikTok sensation in recent months. He joins frequently censored CEO of the Babylon Bee Seth Dillon, student activist and political commentator Charlie Kirk, radio host and political commentator Maajid Nawaz, retired football player Matthew Le Tissier, plus many more on the platform.  
   
“GETTR is one year old and in this short time has become the fastest growing social media platform in the world. It believes in free speech, it believes in open debate, and it promises not to shadowban you. I’ve signed up, and I hope you do too!” Nigel Farage said.  
   
“We are proud to be able to provide a platform where thought leaders like Nigel Farage can share their political analysis and connect with audiences from across the globe without the threat of being banned. Nigel is someone who exemplifies the GETTR brand: authentic, outspoken and unafraid of cancel culture, and we are thrilled to have him join our movement. GETTR is committed to fighting for a space where debate can flow freely once again and where social media is fun,” GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said.  
   
Today, GETTR proudly hosts 6 million users in 192 different countries and is the fastest-growing social media company in history. The platform has also hit 200 million livestream views since the launch of that feature just 10 months ago. GETTR will soon announce plans to allow users to monetize on the platform, without the threat of censorship.
