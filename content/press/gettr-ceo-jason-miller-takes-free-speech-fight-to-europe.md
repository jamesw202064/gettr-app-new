Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of the new social media platform GETTR and former Senior Advisor to President Donald J. Trump, travelled to Europe last week for a whirlwind tour to protect free speech and fight cancel culture.

In an interview with the Gateway Pundit in London following meetings with former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and French presidential hopeful Éric Zemmour, Miller discussed GETTR’s global fight against censorship as well as his recent detainment in Brazil, which was initiated by one member of Brazil’s Supreme Court.

From the [Gateway Pundit:](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/09/gettr-goes-global-jason-miller-whirlwind-tour-france-uk/) “On the day of his detention, approx. 30 million Brazilians took to the streets on Brazilian Independence Day to protest for freedom of speech. Ever since, there has been a run on GETTR by Brazilians, who now make up the third-largest target audience on the platform. “There’s still a huge amount of support for Bolsonaro in Brazil, no matter what the polls and media say. Unfortunately, the media in Brazil are just as leftist as in the USA, so that’s where GETTR comes in.’”

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already has amassed more than two million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
