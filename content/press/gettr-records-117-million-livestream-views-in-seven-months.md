Social media platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/52f0077f) has recorded a stunning 117 million combined views since introducing livestreaming technology on the site in October 2021, further cementing its dominance as the leading free speech platform.  
   
GETTR recorded 33.7 million combined views on streams on the website in March, nearly triple the 11.7 million views recorded in February. The site, which is the fastest growing social media platform in history, has established a nearly [24/7 roster of livestreams](https://gettr.com/post/p175a8te002) from across the globe and is increasingly the platform of choice for politically uncensored entertainment and news.  
   
In January, nearly one million people logged into GETTR to watch former President Donald Trump’s rally in Florence, Arizona. On Monday, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller will also begin streaming a daily show, “Miller Live,” while radio host and activist [Charlie Kirk](https://gettr.com/user/charliekirk11) started streaming his top-rated “The Charlie Kirk Show” on GETTR last week.  
   
Once fully rolled out later in 2022, livestreaming on GETTR will allow content creators and regular users to broadcast video and interact directly with other users without the threat of shadow banning, censorship, or demonetization — taking on Big Tech heavyweights like YouTube.  
   
“These figures cement GETTR’s role as not only a social media platform, but a streaming service which can go toe-to-toe with sites like YouTube which for too long has censored and demonetized voices they don’t like. Our users know GETTR is the place to access uncensored political takes from around the world and we are excited to introduce even more features in 2022,” said Miller.  
   
Today, GETTR has more than 5.5 million registered users in every continent except Antarctica, and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.  
   
Leading commentators streaming on the platform include political experts Dinesh D’Souza, Steve Cortes, Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec, radio hosts Charlie Kirk, Tim Young, Mark Kaye, Bill Mitchell, and Todd Starnes, activists Amala Ekpunobi, Christine Yeargin, Christian Walker, Isabel Brown, and journalists Andy Ngo and Natalie Winters.  
   
Networks from across the globe are also choosing to broadcast on GETTR, including Americano Media, Right Side Broadcasting Network, Real America’s Voice, Newsmax, Brado Radio, Nossa Radio, VA+, and Livre Noir.  
   
International stars streaming on GETTR include UK political commentators Maajid Nawaz and Dominique Samuels, football legend Matthew Le Tissier, Lotus Eaters, Hearts of Oak, Voice of Wales and David Vance, while political leaders like Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazilian Federal Deputy Bia Kicis, former French presidential candidates Eric Zemmour and Florian Philippot, and former Austrian parliamentarian Gerald Grosz also chose the platform to communicate directly with voters.
