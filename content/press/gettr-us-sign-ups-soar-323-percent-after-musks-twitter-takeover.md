Free speech social media platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/52f0077f) saw a stunning surge in new sign-ups in the final week of April, with U.S. based sign-ups soaring by over 300 percent.  
  
Globally, new sign-ups on GETTR grew 70 percent, while sign-ups in the United States increased by 323 percent. GETTR’s place on the Apple App Store and Google Play store also rose 56 spots and 42 spots respectively.  
  
“GETTR’s continued growth is proof that people around the world are hungry for a platform with a true commitment to protecting political free speech and fighting a growing culture of censorship. Our users know that they will not be censored or banned because of their political opinions, and that appeals to people of all backgrounds,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.  
  
Today, GETTR has more than five million registered users on every continent except Antarctica and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first one million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021, and reaching 1.5 million users in only 10 days. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months to reach one million users.  
  
Next week, GETTR will unveil a new streaming homepage ahead of several exciting new features in 2022, including Vision, a short video platform alternative to TikTok and Instagram Reels, encrypted direct messages, online appreciation and tipping for content creators, and GETTR Pay, a cryptocurrency-based payment system.  
  
Leading commentators streaming on the platform include political experts Dinesh D’Souza, Steve Cortes, Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec, radio hosts Tim Young, Mark Kaye, Bill Mitchell, and Todd Starnes, activists Amala Ekpunobi, Christine Yeargin, Christian Walker, Chandler Crump and Isabel Brown, and journalists Andy Ngo and Natalie Winters.  
  
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](http://www.gettr.com/).
