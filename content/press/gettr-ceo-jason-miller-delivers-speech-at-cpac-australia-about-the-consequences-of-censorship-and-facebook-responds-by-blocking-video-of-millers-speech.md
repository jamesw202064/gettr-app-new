Rampant censorship at the hands of Big Tech oligarchs imperils online debate and dissent and has grave consequences for free speech, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller warned in a fiery speech at CPAC Australia on Sunday that was later [blocked by Facebook](https://twitter.com/JasonMillerinDC/status/1576461942360707072).  
   
Speaking to a crowd of hundreds following a whirlwind multi-city tour of Australia, Miller said the next freedom revolution would be fought on platforms like GETTR amid a troubling rise in Big Tech censorship, and said people must fight back against unreasonable acts of deplatforming and shadowbanning designed to squash political debate.  
   
“There is nothing free about free speech. If we want to protect free speech, we have to fight for free speech,” Miller said. “Except this time, the freedom revolution will not be televised, it will be livestreamed, it will be discussed; it will be on social media that we connect, that we can get together with each other, talk about these ideals and make sure our freedoms are never taken away.”

“With GETTR, the reason why we made this app is to make sure that this was always going to be protected and our goal, our vision, whether you’re on the left, whether you’re on the right, whether you don’t even care about politics, that freedom is always going to be protected,” he went on.  
   
Ironically, at least one video clip of Miller’s speech was unreasonably blocked by Facebook, preventing users of the platform from being able to see Miller’s important message about freedom of expression, cementing the importance of a platform like GETTR with a firm commitment to protecting online debate for people regardless of their political views.  
   
Miller has just concluded a three-city tour of Australia with former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage as downloads of GETTR increase 10,000 percent in the country. Today, GETTR has over 6 million users in 192 different countries worldwide. Since launching on July 4, 2021, GETTR has become the fastest growing social media platform in history, reaching one million users in less than 3 days.  
   
The platform recently hit 250 million livestream views after launching the technology last October and will soon announce major plans to allow content creators to monetize their work and keep more of their money.  
   
Some of the most notable GETTR user accounts include Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, former White House chief strategist and “War Room” host Steve Bannon, feminist author Naomi Wolf, radio great and author Mark Levin, investigative journalist Andy Ngo, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, podcasting great Joe Rogan, MMA fighter Gina Carano, Australian basketball legend and NBA Champion Andrew Bogut, and music stars Richard and Fred Fairbrass from Right Said Fred.
