A day after his hard-hitting op-ed appeared in The National Pulse, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller kept up the heat on POLITICO for their hit piece targeting the new free speech social media platform. In an appearance on Steve Bannon’s War Room on Wednesday, Miller blasted POLITICO for inadequately seeking comment from GETTR for their story and again exposed POLITICO for relying on a source whose work is funded by GETTR’s competitors in the tech and social media marketplace.

POLITICO’s hit piece dropped at 4:30 a.m. on August 2nd with the original headline claiming that GETTR is a “safe haven” for Islamic extremists from ISIS, despite identifying only 250 Jihadist accounts out of nearly two million registered users. The story initially contained no response from GETTR representatives.

One of the reporters on the POLITICO story said she attempted to text Miller and tried to send an email to another GETTR representative through a generic form on his personal business website. Miller said he never received the text and the email landed in a junk folder.

Miller said there is no excuse for being unable to reach him because he has been in recent contact with more than a half-dozen reporters from POLITICO in just the past few days and has had numerous interactions with this particular POLITICO reporter in the past.

“Everybody at Politico has my cell number. Everybody knows how to reach me,” Miller told Bannon. “They do this when they’re teaming up to specifically try to knock out a Trump person or a MAGA movement person. This, folks, is a hit piece.”

The POLITICO story was based on research supplied by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that examines extremism online. The group’s executive director, Moustafa Ayad, provided POLITICO with his conclusions regarding the ISIS content, which prompted the story.

“So, he’s the one who quote-unquote ‘discovered’ these couple of posts and brought them to POLITICO. To POLITICO’s credit, they did identify that he’s the one who brought it forward,” Miller said. “But these reporters are so blanking lazy. Not only could they not make a single phone call, literally these are the worst people on the planet. They can’t make a phone call. They also don’t even ask the question: ‘Hey, Mr. Moustafa Ayad, who funds you?’”

It turns out that the Institute for Strategic Dialogue is funded by Big Tech giants from Silicon Valley – the very same corporations now in competition with GETTR.

“Facebook, Google, YouTube, Microsoft. Industry Big Tech giants are who fund him, and they don’t even point that out – the oligarchs – they don’t even point that out in the story because these reporters are so damned lazy,” Miller said. “They have an agenda. They have a liberal biased agenda.”

And Miller made clear that he knows why Big Tech colluded with POLITICO to launch an attack on GETTR.

“They’re scared of us. They know that we’re growing, they know we’ve added two million users to the platform, the Make America Great Again movement here in the U.S.,” Miller said. “We look internationally where we see President Bolsonoro in Brazil, where we’re growing. This movement, this rejection of the Big Tech oligarchs is growing. People love the technology. And there’s a reason why we have so many people joining GETTR every day.”

Bannon offered his assessment that it’s ludicrous to think that ISIS would flock to a social media platform so closely associated with the Trump Make America Great Again movement.

“Last time I looked, I thought the Trump movement were the guys who actually destroyed the physical caliphate,” Bannon said. “The reason they’re down in caves somewhere on a keyboard is because Donald J. Trump dropped the hammer and shattered it.”

GETTR officially launched on July 4th and has already amassed nearly two million registered users, achieving its first million users less than three days after launch. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
