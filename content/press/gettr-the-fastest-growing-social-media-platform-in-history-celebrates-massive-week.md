Free speech social media platform GETTR is capping off another blockbuster week of global growth following the site’s sponsorship of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Orlando, Florida, and Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller’s recent trip to Europe. 

Daily sign-ups surged by an enormous 550 percent in the U.S. last week while the platform has grown at a stunning 50 percent rate in 2022. [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/conservatives-slam-big-tech-cpac-touting-parallel-economy-rcna17763) on Saturday noted GETTR’s “major presence” at CPAC, which included “prominent sponsorship markers on the main speaker stage and throughout the conference space.” 

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s address to the conference on Saturday evening hit close to 250,000 views on live-streams from GETTR partners [Real America’s Voice](https://gettr.com/user/RealAmVoice) and [Right Side Broadcasting Network](https://gettr.com/user/rsbnetwork).

It was also another week of explosive growth internationally following Miller’s trip to the United Kingdom, France and Germany. Sign-ups in the U.K. soared 61 percent after Miller’s media tour which included an appearance on GB News alongside commentator [Maajid Nawaz](https://gettr.com/user/maajidnawaz), who recently inked a content partnership with GETTR. Writer [Dominique Samuels](https://gettr.com/user/dominiquetaegon) also announced her partnership with GETTR on Monday.

In Germany, daily sign-ups exploded by 111 percent following Miller’s appearance on the weekly [Corona Committee](https://gettr.com/user/coronaausschuss) live-stream on Friday, which hit 80,000 views. Sign-ups in Brazil were also up 33 percent last week largely thanks to strategic partner [Hoje no Mundo Militar](https://gettr.com/user/hoje_no) and their coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

“Just seven months after launching, GETTR has cemented itself as the leading free speech social media platform to take on Big Tech censorship globally. We are proud to fight for free speech, wherever it is under threat, and give people a platform where they can express their right to freedom of expression,” said Miller.

Later this year, the platform will publicly unveil Vision, a short video platform to take on TikTok and Instagram Reels, wider access to live-streaming, encrypted direct messages, online appreciation and tipping for content creators, and a two-coin cryptocurrency-based payments system.

GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having successfully onboarded its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months. Today, GETTR has nearly five million registered users and has grown at a rate of 50 percent in 2022.
