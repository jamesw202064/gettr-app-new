In an interview with Daniel Teng of The Epoch Times Australia, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller sounded the alarm of the potential threats the ever-evolving Metaverse poses on all individuals, particularly as it pertains to the younger generation.  
   
Miller asserted that the Metaverse pushes towards a utopian society where individuals have the capability to enhance and alter their real-life identity in an attempt to enhance longevity - a key component of the transhumanist philosophy and movement:   
   
“Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse will encourage people to distance themselves from reality and devote more time to the virtual world, says GETTR CEO Jason Miller.”  
   
“Miller, who founded GETTR in July 2021 in response to censorship from incumbent social media services, said Meta’s endeavours to create a virtual world is an attempt by the tech giant to capture more of the youth audience that it is losing to other platforms.”  
   
“‘It seems to be a computerised extension of identity politics,’ he told The Epoch Times. ‘Hey, I’m going to live online and have this different person or version of who I am. By the way, I can go and buy things when I’m online to make my online person cooler and different. It’s not real life, and I think there’s a certain point where you start getting into transhumanism and all kinds of weirdo stuff. It’s not that big of a leap,’ he said.”  
    
“‘\[Zuckerberg\] knows that only two percent of kids under 18 are on Facebook, and he knows that it’s a dying platform,’ he said. ‘That’s why he’s trying to merge it essentially with \[Meta-owned\] Instagram. If you go on Facebook now, after you click a couple of times it is almost indistinguishable from Instagram. He’s almost started morphing them together,’ he added.”

GETTR also released a free edit feature for all users - beating out Twitter’s paid capability.   
   
The platform proudly represents many high-profile users including British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, War Room host and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, author and journalist Naomi Wolf, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British football legend Matt Le Tissier, radio host and author Mark Levin, actress and former MMA fighter Gina Carano, Australian basketball legend and NBA Champion Andrew Bogut, and music stars Richard and Fred Fairbrass from Right Said Fred.
