More and more people are looking for alternatives to the Big Tech social media giants because they feel their voices are being marginalized, and GETTR is becoming their destination. GETTR saw one million new accounts opened in the week following podcaster [Joe Rogan]()’s announcement that he had created an account, and the free speech platform now boasts more than four million registered users.

Carrie Sheffield, senior policy analyst at Independence Women’s Voice and a fellow at The Steamboat Institute, focused on GETTR’s rise in a new piece for [NBCNews.com]().

Sheffield’s piece reads, in part:

Another startup, Gettr, which supporters call “the Twitter killer,” launched in July. The platform got a huge boost last week when broadcasting phenom Joe Rogan joined. Gettr spokesman Kaelan Dorr told me Rogan was not paid and heard about it organically from a guest on Rogan’s show.

Dorr also said the platform now has more than 4 million registered users, and its biggest user base is the United States, with 2.2 million users, followed by Brazil at half a million (Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is a prominent user) and the U.K., Germany and France at over 300,000 each.

“I think when Joe Rogan joined Gettr, it represented the ‘Great Awakening,’ and it triggered almost a million people to open accounts in the week after his announcement,” Gettr CEO Jason Miller said in an emailed statement to me, via Dorr. “Rogan is not a right-winger, but is instead a guy who cuts through the prevailing narrative and calls it like he sees it. He is willing to allow competing ideas to be heard, which is what we provide on Gettr.”

Other prominent Gettr users include Canadian author Jordan B. Peterson, Boston Celtics player Enes Kanter Freedom and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Dozens of members of Congress — including Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., plus the U.S. House Freedom Caucus — are also using the platform.

I asked if Miller was concerned about whether America would grow more polarized by the growth of conservative social media enclaves. “We welcome people from across the political spectrum, because true liberals should value free speech just as much as the most conservative person should,” Miller said. “We want vigorous debate on our platform, not an echo chamber. That’s what Twitter has become, with the vast, vast majority of users adhering to leftist points of view.”
