GETTR is today announcing that Direct Messages are now available to its entire community of nearly six million users, making GETTR the only free speech platform to have Direct Messages, livestreaming, Vision – a short-video alternative to TikTok and Instagram Reels – and a presence on both the Apple App and Google Play stores.  
   
The company on Monday celebrated its first anniversary, capping off an exceptional first year which saw it become the world’s fastest growing social media platform in history. Since launching livestreaming technology in October, GETTR has reached 160 million livestream views, while Vision has hit more than 3 million views since its introduction just last month.  
   
GETTR has seen tremendous growth based on its promise to never sell user data or censor a user because of their political views, and is committed to creating competition by taking on larger Big Tech players like Twitter, Facebook, Google and YouTube.  
   
Almost 400,000 Android users immediately downloaded the latest version of the GETTR app on Monday following the release of DMs on the Google Play Store, while more than 100,000 people tuned in to watch the platform’s star-studded live programming on its July 4 anniversary.  
   
“In just one year, GETTR has become the leading free speech platform. With our global community and tireless innovation, we are creating real competition in the marketplace and independence from the Silicon Valley social media oligarchs. We have never been more optimistic about our fight against cancel culture and censorship and welcome people from all political backgrounds to join our movement,” said GETTR CEO Jason Miller.  
   
GETTR is a truly global company with users in 192 different countries and half of its audience based outside of the United States. Famous names from around the world joined the GETTR livestream to reflect on the company’s first year and the ongoing global fight for freedom of expression, including Brazilian politicians Eduardo Bolsonaro and ​​Carla Zambelli, French MEP Jérôme Rivière, German journalist Boris Reitschuster, political commentators Jack Posobiec and Dinesh D’Souza, UK football legend Matt Le Tissier, Brazilian YouTuber Gustavo Gayer, UK political commentator Maajid Nawaz, plus many more.  
   
The celebrations will continue with GETTR’s first anniversary party this Thursday, which will see GETTR employees and a star-studded lineup of key conservative influencers and allies gather to toast GETTR on the rooftop of its New York City headquarters. Five lucky GETTR users will also attend the celebration after winning an all-expenses paid trip to New York.  
   
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at www.GETTR.com.
