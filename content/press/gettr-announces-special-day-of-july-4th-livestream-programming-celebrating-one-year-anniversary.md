_Fastest-growing social media company in history nears 6 million users globally_

Free speech social media platform GETTR has revealed a star-studded lineup of global guests for a special day of live programming to mark the company’s first anniversary since its founding on Independence Day 2021.  
   
Some of the platform’s most famous faces including Brazilian politician Eduardo Bolsonaro, journalist Andy Ngo, political expert Jack Posobiec, UK football legend Matt Le Tissier, French MEP Jérôme Rivière, plus many more, will join GETTR CEO Jason Miller to reflect on the company’s historic first year and the global fight against censorship.  
   
GETTR CTO Ken Huang also appear on July 4 to discuss what exciting new features the social media company will be announcing later in 2022, including a big reveal on Monday which will cement GETTR’s status as the leading alternative platform.  
   
“I am so excited to celebrate GETTR’s whirlwind first year with our global community and reveal our next big feature which will serve another blow to Big Tech’s reign of tyranny on freedom of speech around the world,” Mr. Miller said.  
   
“Over the past 12 months, we have built a passionate, global audience committed to fighting against online censorship and cancel culture, and I hope that people from all walks of life will tune in on July 4 to help us celebrate the first of many GETTR anniversaries and just how far our movement has come,” he said.  
   
Five lucky users will also win the chance to attend GETTR’s first anniversary party, which will see employees and a star-studded lineup of key conservative influencers and allies gather to toast GETTR on the rooftop of its New York City headquarters.  
   
Today, GETTR has nearly 6 million registered users in every continent except Antarctica, and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.  
   
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at www.GETTR.com.
