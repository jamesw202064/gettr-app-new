[GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, has seen a tremendous increase in new users and a spike in engagement rates since former President Donald Trump announced the formation of his own multi-faceted media company on October 20, 2021. Contrary to the dire predictions of the professional left and many in the media, GETTR has surged as more people are waking up to the truth that the Silicon Valley social media giants are trampling on free speech and damaging public discourse.

“We haven’t seen numbers like these since the first week of our launch in July,” said Jason Miller, GETTR’s chief executive officer. “It’s true what they say – a rising tide lifts all boats. And the more competition there is in the social media market, the better it is for GETTR. We are the only real destination for people who want to be able to express their opinions without fear of being canceled or censored.”

GETTR’s recent numbers are eye-catching:

* Total new signups have increased by 135 percent in the eleven days since October 20th, compared to the previous eleven days.
* Average daily signups are up 32 percent from the previous average.
* Daily active users have increased each day since October 20th, by an average of 20 percent.
* Saturday, October 30th marked the highest single day of daily active users since the July launch week.
* GETTR has now recorded 20 million unique posts in under four months of existence.
* GETTR is rapidly closing in on three million registered users.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already is approaching three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
