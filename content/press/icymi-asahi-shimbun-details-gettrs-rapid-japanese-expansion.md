Following the announcement of GETTR’s official entrance into Japan, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller sat down with Daisuke Igarashi of _Asahi Shimbun_ in an extensive interview to discuss the necessity of an online free speech platform in Japan. 

Following the establishment of GETTR JP GK, Mr. Miller is planning to expand the user base in the country when he visits Japan later this year by meeting with esteemed influencers, potential partners, and key political figures. GETTR is dedicated to globally providing individuals an online marketplace to come and share their political ideologies without fear of the cancel culture mob prevailing. GETTR already boasts over 100,000 Japanese users and provides complete Japanese-language support and translation.

Important excerpts from the interview are as follows:   

“Speaking on the company’s focus on Japan, Mr. Miller pointed out that Japan stands out for having some of the highest Twitter usage rates in the world and highlighted the country’s culture and style of using social media. He showed a strong interest in Japan’s political trends too, saying, ‘In addition to new political voices like the Sanseito Party recently winning a seat (in the Upper House elections), there is growing concern about the Chinese Communist Party and strong opposition to North Korean missiles.’”

“Regarding the Sanseito Party he added, ‘I was impressed by the way they were able to harness the power of social media,’ and plans to meet Kamiya Sohei, Sanseito’s leader elected to the Upper House, during his visit to Japan.” 

“Commenting on the recent rise of support conservatives are gaining across different countries, Mr. Miller said, ‘Ultimately, there is a disparity. The working class continues to suffer, not only in the US but all over the world, especially as the cost-of-living crisis spreads.’ He stressed that ‘there is a commonality among those who simply advocate for their country and want to connect with others around the world.’”
