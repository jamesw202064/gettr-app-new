GETTR, the world’s leading free speech social media platform, is today announcing an assortment of new features for all users, including group Direct Messages as a direct alternative to Meta-owned WhatsApp. 

Other updates to the site include enhanced editing capabilities to Vision, GETTR’s short video feature and competitor to TikTok which has had over 40 million views since its launch in June. Vision users will now be able to edit draft videos, music effects, and cover images in the app. 

GETTR remains the only free speech platform to have Direct Messages. These latest updates show the company is the only viable challenger to take on Big Tech’s stranglehold over online expression and create a leading marketplace which fosters debate and a diversity of opinions.

“At GETTR, we are working tirelessly to provide our global community with leading technology that will create real competition in the marketplace and allow people to break away from the Silicon Valley oligarchs. The introduction of group direct messages on GETTR means we are now not only taking on TikTok, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, but WhatsApp too,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.

Since launching on July 4, 2021, GETTR has seen tremendous growth based on its promise to never sell user data or censor a user because of their political views, and is the fastest growing social media platform in history. 

GETTR now boasts nearly 6.5 million users across the globe in 193 different countries and is committed to creating competition by taking on larger Big Tech players like Twitter, Facebook, Google and YouTube.

There have been over 244 million livestreaming views since the release of the feature 11 months ago, along with over 40 million Vision views - the short video feature that is a direct competitor to Instagram Reels and TikTok. Earlier this year, GETTR also released a free edit feature for all users – beating Twitter’s paid version. 

The platform proudly represents many high-profile users including British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, War Room host and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, author and journalist Naomi Wolf, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British football legend Matt Le Tissier, radio host and author Mark Levin, actress and former MMA fighter Gina Carano, Australian basketball legend and NBA Champion Andrew Bogut, and music stars Richard and Fred Fairbrass from Right Said Fred.
