Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GETTR, the new “cancel free” social media platform, today issued the following statement regarding the Senate committee hearing featuring the Facebook whistleblower, Frances Haugen. Ms. Haugen appeared before the Senate committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation’s subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security.

Miller’s statement is as follows:

“The world now knows about Big Tech’s secret plans to target kids and draw them into their platforms. It has been shocking, but somehow not surprising, to learn that children, including pre-teen girls, are viewed as mere assets to guarantee future corporate profits rather than as vulnerable young people susceptible to peer pressure and harm on the Internet. They even strategize how to target children in age brackets reaching down to toddlers, and even younger children.

“The Big Tech giants prohibit pre-teens from using their platforms, but they clearly target them for recruitment anyway. This is beyond wrong. The moneymaking scheme shows a complete disregard for the safety of children online, is a clear attempt to circumvent the role of parents, and is designed to insert their social media platforms into the formative years of children’s lives for the sake of their own future profit.

“Today we see laid bare the problem with the consolidation of power in the hands of just a few American tech billionaires. They have operated with impunity for years while setting the terms of free speech for people around the world. They discriminate against political viewpoints they disapprove of, stifle dissent, and outright ban people who stray from the ‘acceptable’ narrative. They also basically serve as data merchants, selling their users’ information as yet another way to rake in cash.

“At GETTR, we do not target children as potential users and we never will. We will not design special products that are meant to lure children in and get them hooked. Further, unlike Big Tech, we will never sell users’ data as another means of raking in cash. And what really sets GETTR apart is that we are the marketplace of ideas, and we will not cancel users for exercising their 1st Amendment right to free speech.

“Today’s hearing is just more proof that the Silicon Valley social media oligarchs are out of control and believe they are answerable to no one. The good news is that there is an alternative. Everyone who cares about freedom should open an account on GETTR today.”
