S&P Global Market Intelligence last week also [reported](https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spglobal.com%2Fmarketintelligence%2Fen%2Fnews-insights%2Flatest-news-headlines%2Feven-with-ye-parler-faces-headwinds-in-crowded-social-media-market-72578469&data=05%7C01%7Csonnynelson%40gettr.com%7C25cf1b82c3de4bd5c3b808dac3599fa3%7C28bd1cc1db844a90b436b0d2c8c5771a%7C1%7C0%7C638037086934796838%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=B6VA4Fhq6qtQy54hTNV2t%2FQnCiVXp94WPq4Sx1VWrvY%3D&reserved=0) that GETTR drew 7.2 million unique visits in August, according to Similarweb data.

And in Brazil, GETTR saw a 500% increase in sign-ups following the October 30 presidential election, increasing the overall user base in Brazil by 20% as Brazilians flocked to the platform after the Superior Electoral Court ordered the deplatforming of several prominent supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro.

“This data shows us that people are hungry for an alternative platform that values their innate right to freedom of speech and expression. By providing people around the globe a platform where they are free to discuss important issues, whether that be through regular posting, livestreaming, or sharing short videos, GETTR will continue to surge while platforms like Twitter and Facebook become a thing of the past,” said GETTR’s Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. 

With almost 7 million users across 192 different countries and over 280 million livestream views, GETTR is the leading destination for content creators and individuals who seek out uncensored opinions. 

The platform proudly represents many high-profile users including comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, British broadcaster and former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, MMA fighter Jorge Masvidal, actor and comedian Rob Schneider, NBA legend Enes Kanter Freedom, UFC fighter Andrew Tate, War Room host and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon, author and journalist Naomi Wolf, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, British football legend Matt Le Tissier, actress and former MMA fighter Gina Carano, and radio host and author Mark Levin.
