[GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/)’s aerial advertising is getting some serious air time, again being highlighted on Fox News, this time on Hannity on Tuesday night. Host Sean Hannity covered the chants mocking President Joe Biden that are spreading at college football games and other large events and he highlighted GETTR’s banner flying over the Georgia-Auburn football game on October 9, 2021, reading, “[LET’S GO BRANDON! JOIN GETTR.COM!](https://www.gettr.com/post/pe0yg6a425)”

GETTR, the new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, had seen its banner featured previously by anchor Harris Faulkner on Fox News earlier in the day.

The phrase “Let’s go, Brandon!” has quickly become popular on social media as yet another way to deride Biden and is the result of NBC’s interview of NASCAR driver Brandon Brown following his win at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama on October 9. As has been occurring at stadiums across the country, fans were chanting “F*** Joe Biden!” during the live televised interview. Knowing that the television audience could clearly hear the chant, NBC Reporter Kelli Stavast incredibly misdescribed the crowd as cheering for Brown, wrongly explaining that the fans were saying, “Let’s go, Brandon!”

In that moment, an Internet sensation and a GETTR aerial banner were born.

“GETTR is spreading as fast as the chants mocking Joe Biden,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “Sports fans everywhere are exercising their Constitutional rights to express their opinions, which is exactly what everyone can do at GETTR as well. Anyone who cares about the 1st Amendment should open an account on GETTR today.”

GETTR has been flying aerial banners at President Donald Trump’s rallies and at college football games around the country for the past several weeks, encouraging people to open accounts on the platform.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already has amassed more than two million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
