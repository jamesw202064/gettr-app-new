Free speech social media platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848) is proud to announce a new partnership with British football icon and political commentator Matt Le Tissier ([@mattletiss7](https://gettr.com/user/mattletiss7)) which will see him produce exclusive content for the platform.  
   
Matt Le Tissier is someone who exemplifies the GETTR brand: authentic, outspoken and not afraid of cancel culture. He joins a growing stable of UK free speech stars on the platform, including broadcaster Maajid Nawaz, journalist Andy Ngo, and political commentator Dominique Samuels.  
   
Under the deal, Le Tissier will produce a weekly exclusive livestream “_Le Tiss Talks_,” available only on GETTR, where he discusses football, politics and life - no holds barred - and gets to interact live with his biggest fans.  
   
“Matt Le Tissier is an icon on and off the football field and, increasingly, in the fight for free speech. GETTR is proud to give Matt a platform where he can speak freely without the threat of censorship that is increasingly stifling debate on Big Tech platforms,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “With Twitter this week launching a fresh war not only on news, but also satire, GETTR is committed to fighting for a space where political debate can flow freely and where social media is fun again.”  
   
“I’m very much looking forward to engaging with the public on my livestreams – something which I enjoy doing in everyday life. Many thanks to GETTR for allowing me to have this platform to share my thoughts and I look forward to a long and successful partnership,” Le Tissier said.  
   
Other big UK names on GETTR include Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell, GB News presenters Neil Oliver, Dan Wootton, Nana Akua and Calvin Robinson, journalist Andy Ngo, podcaster Joe Rogan, rapper and author Zuby, activist Tommy Robinson, publican Adam Brooks, presenter and restaurateur Tonia Buxton, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Free Speech Union founder Toby Young, writer James Delingpole, singer Gareth Icke, businessman Alan D Miller and ex-boxing champion Jamie Moore, plus many more.  
   
Today, GETTR has 5 million registered users across the globe, and is the fastest growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
