Social media platform GETTR has signed on as a major sponsor of the sold-out fight between boxers KSI and Swarmz at London’s O2 Arena this Saturday, Aug. 27, and will be the only destination to see exclusive behind-the-scenes footage and entertainment from both before and after the fight.  
   
The sponsorship deal is a huge achievement for the world’s fastest growing social media platform and announces GETTR’s arrival as a destination for world class video content that is noisy, opinionated, fun, and most importantly, uncensored.  
   
GETTR users can follow all the action at #GETTRFightNight and will be able to watch exclusive livestreams of the pre-match press conferences, weigh-ins, public work outs and a studio watch along of the fight with a GETTR live chat featuring live reactions, plus much more.  
   
One GETTR user from the UK will also have a chance to win two VIP tickets to the fight. More details on the giveaway will be released this week.  
   
“GETTR is all about hard-hitting free speech and this sponsorship proves we are quickly becoming the world’s leading platform for entertainment, opinion and debate that celebrates diversity instead of stifling it. GETTR will be the only platform to deliver a knockout blow to Silicon Valley’s censorship and we hope users from all around the world will join us for #GETTRFightNight,” GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said.  
   
GETTR’s team will be ringside at the match while the platform’s logo will be present throughout the O2 arena – including prominently featured on the canvas – beaming GETTR’s message of free speech online and a world without Big Tech censorship to millions of people around the globe.  
   
Sponsors believe Saturday’s KSI-Swarmz fight will approach three million pay-per-views (PPV) globally. KSI’s 2019 rematch with Logan Paul was the fifth-biggest PPV fight in history, and the biggest PPV fight ever not featuring Floyd Mayweather. As part of GETTR’s sponsorship deal, GETTR advertising will also be a part of the televised PPV broadcast.  
   
Today, GETTR proudly hosts 6 million users in 192 different countries and is the fastest-growing social media company in history. The platform has also hit 200 million livestream views since the launch of that feature just 10 months ago. GETTR will soon announce plans to allow users to monetize on the platform, without the threat of censorship.  
   
Users on the platform include professional kickboxer and YouTuber Andrew Tate, frequently censored CEO of the Babylon Bee Seth Dillon, student activist and political commentator Charlie Kirk, football content creator Zayn Farooqui, European kickboxing champion Tristan Tate, actress Gina Carano, NBA player Enes Kanter-Freedom, soccer star and presenter Matt Le Tissier, political commentator Steven Crowder, radio host and political commentator Maajid Nawaz, boxing conglomerate Misfits Boxing, plus many more.
