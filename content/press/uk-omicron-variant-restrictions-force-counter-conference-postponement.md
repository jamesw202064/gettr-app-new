As countries worldwide revert to harsh restrictions in response to the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, the previously scheduled December 8th Counter Conference in London has been postponed until early 2022 (national entry rules and venue availability permitting).

In particular, the U.K.’s newly-mandated quarantine of up to 48 hours for all international visitors, regardless of their vaccine status, makes scheduling travel to the conference impossible for many of the conference’s confirmed speakers and participants.

GETTR, the free speech social media platform that fights censorship, is the sponsor of the Counter Conference, which is a call to action to fight the chilling effects of extreme political correctness and Big Tech cancel culture.

“As governments return to mandatory lockdowns and restrictions on movement and gatherings, social media will again be a key link for millions of people to the outside world,” said GETTR CEO Jason Miller. “The ability to express oneself freely is now more important than ever, and these new lockdowns prove once again that GETTR’s presence on the social media landscape is essential. We will continue to build our global platform and eagerly look forward to travel restrictions in the U.K. being lifted so we can resume Counter Conference as originally planned.”

Laurence Fox, the innovator of the Counter Conference and the founder of the Reclaim Party said the day-long event would be back in even stronger force in 2022.

“The need for the Counter Conference is greater than ever and this recent turn of events, stifling the activities of free peoples in our free Western societies, is further proof. We will not give up on our initiatives to take back our Western birthrights and the Counter Conference will be held in coming months bigger than ever.”

All previously purchased tickets will be refunded shortly and additional announcements will follow after the first of the year.
