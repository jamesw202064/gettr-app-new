Free speech social media platform GETTR is proud to announce a new partnership with political commentator, broadcaster and former LBC presenter Maajid Nawaz.

Nawaz, one of the UK’s leading independent voices and the co-founder of a respected British anti-extremism organisation, will produce exclusive videos, live-streams and other content on GETTR without the threat of censorship or cancellation.

"We are proud to be able to provide a platform where thought leaders like Maajid Nawaz can share their political analysis without the threat of being banned and silenced. The ability to question authority and disseminate ideas is the cornerstone of any thriving democracy and GETTR is proud to be at the forefront of that fight for free speech,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.

"Everywhere we look, free speech is under sustained attack. And every political crisis is used to encroach upon it further. We stand at a crossroads. It is up to us to define the world we want for our loved ones in the future. Without the freedom to speak we lose the freedom to exchange ideas. Without the freedom to exchange ideas we lose the ability to think. Without the ability to think we follow into submission and lose liberty. The fightback is on. Join us,” said Maajid Nawaz.

Nawaz is currently leading a campaign against audio giant Spotify, accusing them of refusing to release his upcoming interview with podcaster Joe Rogan on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”

GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history and has seen explosive 50 percent growth in 2022 following the addition of big names like rapper and author Zuby, football legend Matt Le Tissier, GB News presenters Neil Oliver, Nana Akua, and Adam Wootton, journalist Andy Ngo, podcaster Joe Rogan, the U.S. Daily Mail, publican Adam Brooks, presenter and restaurateur Tonia Buxton, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, Free Speech Union founder Toby Young, podcaster James Delingpole, singer Gareth Icke and businessman Alan D Miller, among others.

The platform, which is committed to protecting political speech and taking on Big Tech censorship, is approaching 5 million users just seven months after its July 2021 launch.
