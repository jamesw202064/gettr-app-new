GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller today issued the following statement regarding the elimination of free speech champion Kemi Badenoch from the Conservative leadership race:

“The elimination of Kemi Badenoch from the Conservative Leadership race is bad news for free speech in Britain and across the West.

“Badenoch was the only candidate on record to oppose the dangerous Online Safety Bill – legislation which will squash free speech in the United Kingdom by enabling regulators to label certain kinds of speech as “harmful” even if they were not “illegal.”

“Badenoch should be applauded for using her campaign to help sideline the bill, warning voters that the OSB is “in no fit state to become law” and that the government “should not be legislating for hurt feelings."

“With the elimination of Badenoch from the race, Conservative members will likely no longer have an option on the ballot paper to wholeheartedly reject the poisonous bill and thereby defend political free speech, satire and debate in the UK and the rest of the West.

“I am calling on the other candidates remaining in this race to wholeheartedly reject the Online Safety Bill should they become Prime Minister and consign to the wastebasket the anti- democratic and draconian ideas the bill espouses.”
