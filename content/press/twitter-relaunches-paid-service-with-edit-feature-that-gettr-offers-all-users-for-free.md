Twitter is today relaunching their Twitter Blue service, charging as much as $11/month for platform features that GETTR offers all users free-of-charge. GETTR’s edit feature that launched in September of this year provides all users, regardless of platform verification status, the ability to edit and correct mistakes on a post up to one hour after the initial publication. Additionally, edits to a single post on GETTR can be made up to five times and analytics are available for edited posts. For comparison, Twitter’s paid service allows posts to be corrected only up to 30 minutes after initial publication. 

Other features that come along with a monthly fee at Twitter include 1080p (full HD) video uploads and longer video uploads. Both features come without a price tag at GETTR - free for all users. Beyond these abilities, GETTR provides users more features than even the paid services at Twitter: longer posts, audio and video livestreaming, and the short video component “Vision.”  

Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller issued the following statement on the matter: 

“At every turn, GETTR has beaten Twitter to the punch on innovating. Twitter’s failure to innovate over the years is what has made the platform a stale environment. Requiring users to pay for basic platform features won’t be a winning strategy at Twitter,” he said.  

“In just over a year of existence, GETTR has succeeded in providing users one of the most requested features - something that 16-year-old Twitter could not accomplish for free. GETTR’s superior technology and continued efforts to provide users a unique platform that is fresh and exciting is what has established our company as the only true social media competitor to Big Tech platforms like Twitter.”  

Since the launch of GETTR on July 4, 2021, it has become the fastest growing social media platform in history, reaching one million users in less than three days. By comparison, it took Twitter 24 months to reach that milestone. The platform now hosts over 7 million users worldwide with a presence in 192 different countries. Since the release of the livestreaming feature in October 2021, there have been over 300 million livestream views. In recent months, GETTR has defied market trends, doubling its unique users in the first year of existence, with plans to unveil broader monetization in the coming weeks.
