[GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848) crushed CNN in the Saturday night ratings, capturing a surprise audience of nearly one million viewers for former President Donald Trump’s rally in Arizona and overshadowing the 705,000 people who tuned into the liberal news network, according to recent numbers from Nielsen Media Research.

Three livestreams of the rally from broadcasters Right Side Broadcasting Network, Real America’s Voice and NewsMax ended up with an audience of nearly one million users — or 994,666 to be exact.

Meanwhile, CNN’s coverage, which ignored President Trump’s event in favor of “CNN Newsroom” and “The Movies,” averaged just 705,000 primetime viewers, according to Nielsen figures reported by [The Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/jan/18/inside-beltway-media-turns-president-biden/).

“These numbers should be a wake-up call for the oligarchs in Big Tech and Big Media: your audiences are leaving you in droves for a platform which supports free speech and celebrates a marketplace of ideas,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.

“For too long, Silicon Valley and the liberal news media have bullied and censored people who don’t confine themselves to their worldview. No more. GETTR is taking on these monopolies by giving users everywhere the chance to speak freely and access the information they want to see. We welcome people from all ideological backgrounds to join us.”

GETTR’s huge streaming numbers came as the free speech social media platform continues to experience explosive growth in 2022, amassing 1.3 million new users in two weeks after attracting big names such as Fox News host [Tucker Carlson](https://gettr.com/user/tuckercarlson), podcaster [Joe Rogan](https://gettr.com/user/joerogan), comedian [Rob Schneider](https://gettr.com/user/robschneider), soccer star and announcer [Matt Le Tissier](https://www.gettr.com/user/mattletiss7), former NBA player and podcaster [Andrew Bogut](https://gettr.com/user/andrewbogut), British rapper [Zuby](https://gettr.com/user/zubymusic), Virgin Galactic Chairman [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://gettr.com/user/chamath), and dozens more.
