The Federal Election Commission has cleared Twitter of violating any election laws when it censored the story of Hunter Biden’s laptop in the weeks leading up to the 2020 election. The suppression of the story, which contained details of Hunter Biden’s shady foreign dealings and implicated then-candidate Joe Biden in some of the schemes, served to protect Biden from negative headlines right before Election Day.

Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GETTR, a new social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, today released the following statement:

“This decision from the FEC is bull and everyone knows it. The story about Hunter’s laptop was true, and the contents of his computer showed that he had always sold access to his powerful father, and that Joe Biden knew all about it. It also clearly implied that Joe Biden was in on the financial action.

“The only reason that the story was ever ‘unsubstantiated’ was because Big Tech and the corporate news media conspired not to cover it. The Biden campaign never even denied that the laptop belonged to Hunter.

“The suppression of Hunter’s laptop absolutely had an impact on the 2020 election, and it was not some innocent mistake. It gave the media cover for ignoring it, and polls show that a substantial number of Biden voters would have changed their vote if they had known about it.

“The only good news is that GETTR is now here, and we don’t do political censorship or political discrimination.”
