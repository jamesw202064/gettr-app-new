_Hit The Road, Jack!_

  
Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on Wednesday walked away from the social media giant he helped create in 2006, departing the Board of Directors and leaving in his wake a Big Tech platform built on a culture of censorship, political discrimination and partisanship.  
  
Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GETTR, the leading free speech social media platform which fights cancel culture, today issued the following statement:  
  
“I’m sure I speak for all freedom lovers when I say hit the road, Jack. While Jack Dorsey may have set out to create a platform to foster conversations online, his creation ultimately became Frankenstein’s bride, with Dorsey himself overseeing a sprawling censorship operation which continues to trample freedom of speech by silencing news organizations, academics, scientists, regular users, and even sitting presidents whose views they don’t like.”  
  
“Dorsey may have officially left the building, but in his wake he leaves an organization stacked full of activist employees who will not stop until they have a Kafkaesque stranglehold on how people are allowed to think -- regardless of Elon Musk’s commitment to free speech. This trampling on debate and the fundamentals of democracy is why GETTR exists, and unlike Dorsey, we are here to stay.”  
  
Twitter last week expanded its sprawling censorship operation by announcing it would soon police “crisis misinformation” relating to public health emergencies and armed conflict in yet another naked attack on freedom of expression just days after a senior employee was caught admitting “Twitter does not believe in free speech.”  
  
The policy, allegedly designed to make reliable information more accessible during crisis events like the Ukraine-Russia conflict, comes as left-leaning staff within the organization fight off a $44 billion deal from Elon Musk, who is seeking to purchase the company and overhaul how it treats political speech.  
  
Twitter’s claims that they are trying to protect the public ring especially hollow in the wake of a bombshell Project Veritas [recording](https://gettr.com/post/p1a1j4qd308) of senior Twitter engineer Siru Murugesan, who was caught admitting that the firm “does not believe in free speech” and was made up of “Commie as f–k” staffers who “hate” Musk’s bid to return Twitter to its original value of fostering conversation.  
  
Today, GETTR has more than 5.5 million registered users in every continent except Antarctica, and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.  
  
The platform this month recorded a stunning 117 million combined views since introducing livestreaming technology on the site in October 2021, further cementing its dominance as the leading free speech platform. Once fully rolled out later in 2022, livestreaming on GETTR will allow content creators and regular users to broadcast video and interact directly with other users without the threat of shadow banning, political censorship, or demonetization — taking on Big Tech heavyweights like YouTube.
