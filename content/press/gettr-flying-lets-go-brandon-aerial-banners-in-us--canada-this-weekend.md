Fans at football games in the United States and Canada this weekend will be able to look to the skies and see a message from [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the new social media platform which fights cancel culture and defends the 1st Amendment. GETTR will be flying aerial banners with the message “LET’S GO BRANDON! JOIN GETTR.COM” at games in the U.S., while fans in Montreal will see a banner in French, reading, “ALLEZ BRANDON! GETTR.COM!”

“Football fans have been ‘serenading’ Joe Biden with chants at games across the nation, and it’s a phenomenon that’s spreading, just like GETTR,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “People have the right to make their thoughts on politics or any other topic heard, and GETTR is the perfect place to air them.”

GETTR has been flying similar aerial banners at football games and former President Donald Trump’s rallies for the past several weeks, encouraging people to open accounts on the platform.

The phrase “Let’s go, Brandon!” has quickly become popular on social media as a result of NBC’s interview of NASCAR driver Brandon Brown following his win at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama on October 9. As has been occurring at stadiums across the country, fans were chanting “F*** Joe Biden!” during the live televised interview. Knowing that the television audience could clearly hear the chant, NBC Reporter Kelli Stavast incredibly misdescribed the crowd as cheering for Brown, wrongly explaining that the fans were saying, “Let’s go, Brandon!”

In that moment, an Internet sensation and a GETTR aerial banner were born.

This weekend’s GETTR banner schedule includes:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Friday, October 22nd | Toronto Argonauts at Montreal Alouettes |
| Saturday, October 23rd | LSU at Ole Miss |
|  | N.C. State at Miami |

| Sunday, October 24th | Chicago Bears at Tampa Bay Buccaneers |

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already is approaching three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
