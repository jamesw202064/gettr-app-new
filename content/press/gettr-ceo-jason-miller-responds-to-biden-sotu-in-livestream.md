GETTR CEO Jason Miller delivers response to Biden SOTU in livestream

Silicon Valley oligarchs have become such a menace that President Joe Biden saw fit to mention some of their misdeeds in his State of the Union address. That was a key takeaway from [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848) Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller as he offered his thoughts in a [GETTR livestream](https://www.gettr.com/streaming/pxppgk2a45) following Biden’s remarks to Congress. But Miller also advised social media users not to trust that the current leadership in Washington, D.C. would actually take action to protect free speech or ensure user safety. 

“Let’s give credit where credit is due. Joe Biden did speak about data collection as it pertained to our children. He did speak of the sick and twisted targeting of children, as we have seen, by Facebook and Instagram,” Miller said. “And I thought that it was smart and telling to invite Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen to the speech.”

“So, let’s talk about the buried lead here, and that’s just how toxic, and just how politically cancerous Big Tech has become,” Miller continued. “Facebook execs, and all the other social media platforms, the Big Tech folks, literally contributed tens of millions of dollars to Joe Biden’s campaign. But tonight, he had the Facebook whistleblower herself in the audience, sitting up near the First Lady, and Joe Biden felt free to go and criticize them and take them on.”

But, Miller cautioned, users of social media platforms should not trust that the Washington, D.C. elites will actually do what is right and defend freedom of speech.

“Do we think that anything will actually happen from Joe Biden in taking on Big Tech, other than the quick reference and to point to the rafters in the Capitol? That’s unlikely,” Miller said. “And I think that’s because of Washington’s Big Tech lobby, and I think ultimately the rigged system that we see inside the Beltway.”

And Miller warned that the Biden administration in particular should not be counted on to defend the rights of people to express themselves freely. He noted that White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has admitted that the White House has worked with social media giants to identify specific users and posts and to them with censorship.

“Joe Biden’s administration is packed with Big Tech alums,” Miller said. “They’re never going to allow him to go and truly change or fundamentally alter things. This is why again that the free market must be the ones who take charge and lead, just as we have done with GETTR.”

GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months. Today, GETTR has nearly five million registered users.

GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=d05707d8c7&e=82ee8f8ec6).
