The free speech social media platform [GETTR](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=0d2a429a44&e=82ee8f8ec6) is launching a week-long ad buy on “The Five,” one of the top-rated shows on Fox News, beginning Monday, March 21, 2022. The spot will air Monday through Friday in the 5:00 p.m. (EDT) time slot of “The Five” and represents a buy of five figures.  
   
“Anyone who watches The Five knows that it’s a very entertaining show that features free-wheeling discussions of current events – just like what happens on GETTR,” said Jason Miller, GETTR’s Chief Executive Officer. “Anyone who likes ‘The Five’ will also find a natural home on GETTR because it’s a place where you can express your opinions without fear of being censored or canceled.”  
   
GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months. Today, GETTR has five million registered users.  
   
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=d05707d8c7&e=82ee8f8ec6).
