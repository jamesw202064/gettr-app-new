Free speech social media platform [GETTR](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=0d2a429a44&e=82ee8f8ec6) will once again be the place to watch President Donald Trump’s Save America Rally, this time at 7:00 p.m. (CST) on Saturday, January 29, 2022, live from Conroe, Texas. Live streams from [Right Side Broadcasting Network](https://gettr.com/user/rsbnetwork), [Real America’s Voice,](https://gettr.com/user/realamvoice) and [Newsmax](https://gettr.com/user/newsmax) will be available for users to watch. GETTR is a growing destination for livestreams, as nearly a million people tuned in on GETTR on January 15 to watch Trump’s rally in Florence, Arizona.

 

The stream from Right Side Broadcasting Network garnered [609,000 views](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=5d032971ca&e=82ee8f8ec6), making it the most viewed live-stream on GETTR to date. Combined with simultaneous streams from broadcasters Real America’s Voice and Newsmax, the total number of views on Saturday evening was 994,666.

 

Live-streaming on GETTR is still in beta testing, but once fully rolled out in 2022, will allow content creators and regular users to broadcast video without the threat of shadow banning, censorship, or demonetization — taking on Big Tech heavyweights like YouTube.

 

"The corporate media and Big Tech are determined to prevent President Trump from spreading his America First message, but at GETTR we value free expression,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “What they won’t show you on cable television, or on any of the Silicon Valley oligarchs’ platforms, we are providing in the interest of freedom of speech.”

 

GETTR has emerged as a key streaming platform and challenger to Silicon Valley alternatives like YouTube, which for too long has censored and muted voices it does not like. GETTR is focused on giving users unfiltered access to the world’s most influential voices and fiercest free speech advocates. 

 

GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having amassed its first million users in less than three days following its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.

 

The company has seen a record-breaking start to 2022, amassing 1.3 million new users in two weeks and personalities including Fox News host [Tucker Carlson](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=f0492111d0&e=82ee8f8ec6), podcaster [Joe Rogan](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=f9696b7047&e=82ee8f8ec6), comedian [Rob Schneider](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=254defa957&e=82ee8f8ec6), actor [Dean Cain](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=31c6e622ed&e=82ee8f8ec6), soccer star and announcer [Matt Le Tissier](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=8e2909c808&e=82ee8f8ec6), former NBA player and podcaster [Andrew Bogut](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=726bdb28c4&e=82ee8f8ec6), British rapper [Zuby](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=76d64ad015&e=82ee8f8ec6), Virgin Galactic Chairman [Chamath Palihapitiya](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=590054f3c3&e=82ee8f8ec6), and dozens more.
