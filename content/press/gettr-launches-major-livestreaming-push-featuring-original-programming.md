Free speech social media platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/52f0077f) is today announcing a major push into livestream programming, making it the place to enjoy open and uncensored political analysis from all around the world.  
  
The site, which is the fastest growing social media platform in history, has established a nearly [24/7 roster of livestreams](https://gettr.com/post/p175a8te002) from across the globe, featuring content from the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Latin America, France, Germany, and many more countries.  
  
“For too long, television networks like NBC, CBS and ABC have decided what news people can see, and now we deal with the second threat of politically motivated censorship from online platforms like YouTube and Facebook. No more. GETTR is cementing itself as the leading free speech platform and we’re proud to be innovating in the livestreaming space by providing a place where people can access the news and voices they want to hear,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller.  
  
Next week, GETTR will unveil a new streaming homepage which will make it easy to access livestreams according to the category or topic.  
  
Leading commentators streaming on the platform include political experts Dinesh D’Souza, Steve Cortes, Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec, radio hosts Tim Young, Mark Kaye, Bill Mitchell, and Todd Starnes, activists Amala Ekpunobi, Christine Yeargin, Christian Walker, Chandler Crump and Isabel Brown, and journalists Andy Ngo and Natalie Winters.  
  
Networks from across the globe are also choosing to broadcast on GETTR, including Americano Media, Right Side Broadcasting Network, Real America’s Voice, Newsmax, Brado Radio, Nossa Radio, VA+, and Livre Noir.  
  
International stars streaming on GETTR include UK political commentators Maajid Nawaz and Dominique Samuels, football legend Matthew Le Tissier, Lotus Eaters, Hearts of Oak, Voice of Wales and David Vance, while political leaders like Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Brazilian Federal Deputy Bia Kicis, former French presidential candidates Eric Zemmour and Florian Philippot, and former Austrian parliamentarian Gerald Grosz also chose the platform to communicate directly with voters.  
  
Today, GETTR has more than five million registered users in every continent except Antarctica, and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
