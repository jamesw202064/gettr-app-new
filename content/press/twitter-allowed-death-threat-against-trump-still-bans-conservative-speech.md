On January 9, 2022 an account [linked to the government of Iran](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/free-speech/autumn-johnson/2022/01/12/twitter-allows-iranian-death-threat-against-trump) tweeted a [clear threat](https://twitter.com/Sepah_FA/status/1480266339092729857?s=20) on the life of former President Donald J. Trump and the social media giant has allowed the post to remain. At the same time, Twitter has continued its assault on the free expression of conservatives and others who have opinions that differ from the accepted narrative of the social media oligarchy.

In addition to permanently banning President Donald J. Trump last year, Twitter has recently banned U.S. Representative [Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://gettr.com/user/mtg4america) (R-GA) and [Dr. Robert Malone](https://nypost.com/2022/01/08/twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-has-brought-wave-of-high-profile-bans/), a contributor to mRNA vaccine technology.

Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of the new free speech social media platform GETTR, today issued the following statement:

"If this doesn’t expose Big Tech as unhinged and unprincipled, nothing will. Islamic extremists linked to the government of Iran are free to post death threats against the former President of the United States, but patriotic Americans who have different opinions on COVID are silenced. This goes hand-in-hand with Twitter’s decision to ban President Trump, but allow accounts from Iran’s Supreme Leader, the Taliban, and Hamas.

"This is exactly why millions of people worldwide are waking up and migrating away from the Silicon Valley oligarchs. At GETTR, we value the free speech of freedom-loving people, and we don’t coddle Islamic terrorists.”
