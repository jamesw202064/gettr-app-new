* _Collaboration follows GETTR’s sponsorship of French presidential debate last month_

   
Free speech platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848) has proudly partnered with Colombian television network RCN and newspaper La República to sponsor and livestream the first major interviews with the country’s presidential candidates ahead of next month’s Colombian election.  
   
News program [Noticias RCN](https://gettr.com/user/noticiasrcn) will livestream the full event on GETTR from 9:00am CST (10:00am EST) on Monday April 18 and Tuesday April 19, which will see candidates Sergio Fajardo, Luis Pérez Gutiérrez, Ingrid Betancourt, [Enrique Gómez](https://gettr.com/user/Enrique_GomezM), Gustavo Petro, Rodolfo Hernández, Federico Gutiérrez and John Milton Rodríguez pressed on their stances on major issues.  
   
Last month GETTR also partnered with French conservative magazine [Valeurs Actuelles](https://gettr.com/user/valeurs) to be the main sponsor of the “Grand Debate of Values,” their first presidential debate ahead of the French election.  
   
GETTR chief executive officer Jason Miller will be in Bogotá to attend the RCN event, which will be livestreamed from the offices of newspaper La República and is being held in conjunction with the Bogotá Chamber of Commerce.  
   
“GETTR is proud to sponsor this series of interviews and ensure the people of Colombia are able to know exactly where their candidates stand ahead of the pivotal presidential election. GETTR is committed to defending political free speech everywhere and we are thrilled to be able to make these interviews available to anyone with an interest in Colombia’s democratic process,” Miller said.  
   
Today, GETTR has more than five million registered users in every continent except Antarctica, and is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.  
   
Some of the platform’s most notable users include comedian and actor Russell Brand, podcast hosts Joe Rogan and Tim Pool, New York Times journalist Kara Swisher, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, physician and immunologist Dr. Robert Malone, journalist Andy Ngo, Fox News anchors Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, actor Rob Schneider, plus many more.
