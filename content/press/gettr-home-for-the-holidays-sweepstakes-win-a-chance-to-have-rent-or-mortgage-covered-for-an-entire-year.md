[GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/), the social media platform which defends free speech and fights cancel culture, today announced it will cover one family’s rent or mortgage for all of 2022, providing some relief this holiday season amid the ongoing pandemic and spiraling inflation.

From December 2nd through December 12th, contestants have the chance to enter to win the grand prize of one year’s worth of rent or mortgage (up to $20,000), with the winner to be selected at random by an outside law firm. The [average monthly rent](https://www.earnest.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-rent-in-your-city-or-state/) in America is $1,250 a month, or about $15,000 per year. The median monthly mortgage payment is about $1,600 a month, or about $19,200 per year.

Contestants must have a registered GETTR account to enter and the winner will be publicly announced after the conclusion of the entry period. Registered GETTR users can enter at [http://www.gettrholidaysweeps.com](http://www.gettrholidaysweeps.com "http://www.gettrholidaysweeps.com")

“At GETTR, we’ve always cared about giving our users a platform where they can speak freely, but this holiday season, we want to give them the gift of a home as well,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “The Big Tech oligarchs look down on everyone from their compounds and private islands, but we know that times are tough right now for a lot of people, so we want to say thanks to our community and help with happy holidays and a bright year ahead.”

The Home for the Holidays Sweepstakes follows on the heels of GETTR’s Get Revvin’ Sweepstakes, in which Florida’s [Jeanne Lyle](https://gettr.com/post/pgrrj51d8d) won a brand-new Harley-Davidson® Road Glide® Motorcycle, and the successful Get Truckin’ sweepstakes, in which Lakewood, New Jersey’s [Rafael Goldberg](https://www.gettr.com/post/pc02s5efcf) won a 2021 Ford® F-150®.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already has amassed close to three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever.
