[**GETTR**](http://www.gettr.com/)**, the free speech social media platform which fights cancel culture, today marked its four millionth registered user, passing the milestone at the end of a week that saw nearly one million people sign up after podcast superstar** [**Joe Rogan**](https://gettr.com/user/joerogan) **announced he had created an account. The numbers show that GETTR has attracted an average of nearly 667,000 new users each month in its first six months.**

**GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having amassed its first million users in less than three days following its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.**

**“This is more evidence of the ‘Great Awakening’ among social media users, who are fed up with the heavy-handed censorship of the Silicon Valley oligarchs,” said GETTR’s Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “GETTR keeps gathering momentum and is clearly the destination of choice for people around the world who don’t want to be canceled for their political opinions.”**

**GETTR was already growing rapidly when Rogan joined the platform, but his simple announcement on Sunday, January 2, “**[**Join me on GETTR**](https://twitter.com/joerogan/status/1477715450477830156?s=20)**,” touched off a massive migration from Twitter to the new free speech social media platform. The “Joe Rogan Wave” was the highest level of new user registration since the days immediately following GETTR’s launch.**

**Rogan’s decision to join GETTR came on the same day Twitter permanently banned the personal account of U.S. Representative** [**Marjorie Taylor Greene**](https://gettr.com/user/mtg4america) **(R-GA), citing her opinions as violations of the social media giant's COVID-19 policies, despite some of them being demonstrably true. Meanwhile, YouTube censored Rogan’s interview with** [**Dr. Robert Malone**](https://gettr.com/user/rwmalonemd)**, a contributor to mRNA vaccine technology, who was also deplatformed by Twitter for his remarks on the COVID-19 vaccine, before he joined GETTR on December 29.**

**Rogan, the host of popular podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” made his first post on GETTR just one minute after he announced his decision on Twitter,** [**saying**](https://gettr.com/post/plg71j5d09)**, “Just in case shit over at Twitter gets even dumber, I'm here now as well. Rejoice!”**
