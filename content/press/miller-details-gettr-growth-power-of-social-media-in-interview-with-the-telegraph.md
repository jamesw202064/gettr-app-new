Social media platforms broadcasting heartbreaking images of the Russian-Ukraine war have the power to dissuade modern warfare while also encouraging an open and honest global conversation, Jason Miller, the Chief Executive Officer of free speech platform [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848), said in a new interview with UK newspaper [The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/03/05/donald-trumps-former-aide-social-media-will-do-dissuade-warfare/).

“I think that when military historians take a look at kinetic warfare engagement, they look at the number of troops, anti-aircraft missiles, planes and tanks – but the thing that they are never able to predict with specificity is the public reaction,” Miller said in the wide-ranging interview with Associate Editor Camilla Tominey in London.

“I firmly believe that social media will do more to dissuade kinetic warfare in the future than possibly any amount of tanks or bombs or soldiers on the ground,” he added.

Miller also detailed GETTR’s ongoing rise as the world’s leading alt-tech platform – experiencing 50 percent growth in 2022 and a 135 percent surge in sign ups following the launch of former President Donald Trump’s platform Truth Social – and said it was “only a matter of time” before Trump joined GETTR.

“We have a passionate, well-built audience that wants to hear his views,” he said.

“We know that 20 percent of domestic US Trump supporters quit social media when he was thrown off the platforms. \[Truth Social\] is going to get more Americans off the sidelines and back onto social media.”

“At GETTR, we saw 135 per cent growth when that happened. Every time President Trump talks about social media, we see growth on our platform. The pendulum on free speech is in the center-Right at the moment.”

Miller was recently in Europe as GETTR continues to explode both in the United States and internationally. Today, GETTR has nearly 5 million users on every continent but Antartica, with 46 percent based outside of the US, and is the fastest growing social media platform in history.

  
Miller, a former Senior Advisor to Trump, on Friday [called out Twitter](https://about.gettr.com/press/la-suspension-des-comptes-de-campagne-de-zemmour-et-le-pen-par-twitter-est-iindication-indeniable-dune-censure-politique) for shutting down dozens of accounts in France linked to the campaigns of presidential candidates Eric Zemmour and Marine Le Pen in what was another incident of politically-motivated censorship that Twitter later claimed was an “accident.”
