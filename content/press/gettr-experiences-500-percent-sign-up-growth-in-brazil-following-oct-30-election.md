Free speech social media platform GETTR has seen an enormous 500% increase in sign-ups from Brazil in the wake of last week’s presidential election, leading to a 20% growth in its overall Brazilian user base.

Brazilians have flocked to the platform in recent days following the voting out of President Jair Bolsonaro and a string of high-profile account suspensions ordered by Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE), sparking concerns about free speech rights in Brazil.

GETTR has added over 225,000 new accounts since the second-round election on October 30, taking the total number of Brazilian users to approximately 1.2 million, or roughly 17.4 percent of GETTR’s global user base, which is now almost to 7 million user accounts. The 500% increase in sign-ups is compared to the week before election day. 

“Brazilians have flocked to GETTR in the last week because they know the platform will defend their right to freely express themselves and safeguard their ability to access important information on issues they care about,” GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller said.

“We are humbled that the Brazilian people continue to put their trust in GETTR and we are as committed as ever to protecting free speech rights wherever they are under threat around the world, whether it be from Big Tech platforms, overzealous authorities, or both,” he added.

GETTR last week filed a formal appeal with Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE) petitioning it to overturn an order forcing GETTR to remove the profile of Federal Deputy Carla Zambelli under threat of heavy fines and complete platform suspension, calling it an overreach which harms the freedom of expression.

Specifically, GETTR’s Brazilian legal counsel asked the TSE to reconsider their ruling to suspend the account of Zambelli, which is an overburdensome and politically discriminating maneuver, saying it was more appropriate for the Court to suggest specific posts be removed if found to have violated Brazilian law.

Today, GETTR is one of the world’s leading alternative social media platforms and has defied market trends to double its unique user count in its first year. The platform has almost 7 million users in 192 countries and has recorded more than 280 million livestream views.

Top users on the platform including Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Federal Deputy for São Paulo Eduardo Bolsonaro, Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, politician Carlos Bolsonaro, model Luana Delevedove, singers Bella Falconi and Netinho, Jovem Pan commentator Zoe Martínez, Federal Deputy Bia Kicis, Pastor Davi Passamani and businessman Luciano Hang.
