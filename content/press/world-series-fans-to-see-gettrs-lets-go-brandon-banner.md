[GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/)’s “Let’s Go Brandon!” aerial banner tour will make a stop at the World Series this weekend in Atlanta, as the new social media platform will fly its message over Truist Park prior to Games 4 and 5 between the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves on Saturday and Sunday. GETTR, the new social media platform which fights cancel culture and defends free speech, has become known for displaying its airborne advertising above large gatherings over the past month.

“Leftist activists and woke executives at Major League Baseball may have stolen the All-Star Game from Atlanta, but they can’t stop the World Series,” said Jason Miller, GETTR’s Chief Executive Officer. “‘Let’s Go Brandon’ is one way for people to express their opinion of Joe Biden, who pushed baseball to move the All-Star Game over Georgia’s law protecting election integrity, just like GETTR is a sure way to declare independence from the Silicon Valley social media oligarchs.”

GETTR has been flying similar aerial banners at college football games and former President Donald Trump’s rallies for the past several weeks, encouraging people to open accounts on the platform. GETTR even flew a banner in French (“ALLEZ BRANDON”) above a home game for the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th and already is approaching three million registered users. GETTR achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
