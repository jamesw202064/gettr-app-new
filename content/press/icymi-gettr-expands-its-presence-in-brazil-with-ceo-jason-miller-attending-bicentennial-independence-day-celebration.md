In honor of Brazil’s 200th year of independence, GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller joined hundreds of thousands of patriotic Brazilians in the streets of Rio de Janeiro on September 7 to celebrate the hard-fought freedoms in the country.  
 

Social media platform GETTR hosted a massive presence at the celebration on Avenida Atlantica, boasting a giant inflatable sign encouraging individuals to continue their fight for free speech online.  
 

In an exclusive interview with Folha De S. Paula, Miller explained the importance of GETTR’s mission across the globe:  
 

_"I fundamentally believe that free speech is a divine right," says Miller. "The ability to communicate, to share opinions, is what separates us from animals and what makes us unique. It's also what separates democracies from authoritarian states."_  
 

“According to Miller, of the 6.5 million Gettr users, about 900,000 are Brazilians. The figure leaves Brazil behind the US, which has half of the total accounts, and ahead of the UK, with 10%. The site is now fully translated into Portuguese and was given the green and yellow colors on the 7th of September.”

GETTR remains the fastest growing social media platform in history, reaching 1 million users in just under 3 days after the launch in 2021. GETTR now hosts over 6 million users worldwide, with users in 193 different countries. The social media platform recently released new features such as Vision - the short video component that is a direct competitor to TikTok and Instagram Reels - and it has already received a massive 39 million views. There have been over 200 million livestreaming views since the release of the feature 11 months ago. GETTR also released a free edit feature for all users - beating out Twitter’s paid capability.  
 

Some of the most high-profile GETTR user accounts include Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, comedian and podcaster Russell Brand, conservative news commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, feminist author Naomi Wolf, British broadcaster and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, British football commentator Matt Le Tissier, radio host and author Mark Levin, and former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
