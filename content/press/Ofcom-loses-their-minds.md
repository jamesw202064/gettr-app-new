British communications regulator Ofcom (Office of Communications) launched [another attack](https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/1648064/free-speech-internet-online-safety-bill-ofcom-meghan-markle-twitter) on free speech in the United Kingdom Wednesday when it announced it was opening an investigation into GB News and presenter Mark Steyn after he hosted [Dr. Naomi Wolf](https://gettr.com/user/drnaomirwolf) earlier this month to discuss widely reported side effects of a particular COVID-19 vaccine.  
   
The probe by the government’s communications watchdog was “justified” on the grounds that Wolf’s comments raised “potential issues” under the Broadcasting Code; a deeply vague reasoning which should be seen as part of a troubling onslaught against public debate and a diversity of opinions – this time from the British government itself.  
   
In a post on her [GETTR account](https://gettr.com/post/p1u0hwxa046), Dr. Wolf wrote: “Ofcom is harming British viewers by censoring facts critical to their health - and especially to women’s health.”  
   
Dr. Wolf continued her Ofcom criticism in an appearance on Steve Bannon’s War Room Wednesday afternoon, noting that "the thing that's particularly disorienting is that they're not saying I was wrong. They're saying the truth is harmful."  
   
This is the second Ofcom investigation into Steyn this year. Broadcaster [Piers Morgan](https://www.express.co.uk/comment/expresscomment/1648064/free-speech-internet-online-safety-bill-ofcom-meghan-markle-twitter) was also placed under investigation by the Ofcom’s thought police when he – while exercising his free speech rights – voiced criticism of Meghan Markle. Ofcom’s continued efforts to silence opinions that government elitists disagree with is extremely dangerous to the essential right of free speech in the UK.  
   
GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller weighed in with the following statement:  
   
“Ofcom is now a censorship-first speech enforcer and anything but an independent regulator, that is clear, but let’s look at the bigger picture. Giving more power to Ofcom through the proposed Online Safety Bill being debated would be a recipe for disaster. This watchdog entity is out of control and must be reformed before they destroy all free speech in the UK.”
