Over 700,000 people have flocked to [GETTR](http://www.gettr.com/) in the three days following the announcement from podcasting megastar [Joe Rogan](https://gettr.com/user/joerogan) that he had created an account on the platform, pushing the total number of users to the edge of four million.

At 1:56 p.m. on Sunday, January 2, Rogan took to Twitter with the simple message, “[Join me on GETTR](https://twitter.com/joerogan/status/1477715450477830156?s=20),” and touched off a massive migration from the Silicon Valley giant to the new free speech social media platform. More than 171,000 people followed Rogan’s lead that day by signing up for GETTR, over 341,000 joined Monday, and an additional 195,000 registered Tuesday, for a total of over 707,000 since Sunday afternoon.

“The ‘Joe Rogan Wave’ marks a pivotal moment in the battle for free speech,” said Jason Miller, Chief Executive Officer of GETTR. “GETTR’s momentum has been consistently building, and this flood of new users represents a significant turning of the tide. This is not just a numerical counting of new users – it’s an awakening. The clear message has been sent to the Silicon Valley oligarchs that their policy of censoring opposing points of view will no longer be tolerated.”

The explosion of new GETTR users is by far the biggest since the first days of its official launch on July 4, 2021.

Rogan’s decision to join GETTR came on the same day Twitter permanently banned the personal account of U.S. Representative [Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://gettr.com/user/mtg4america) (R-GA), citing her opinions as violations of the social media giant's COVID-19 policies, despite some of them being demonstrably true. Meanwhile, YouTube censored Rogan’s interview with [Dr. Robert Malone](https://gettr.com/user/rwmalonemd), a contributor to mRNA vaccine technology, who was also deplatformed by Twitter for his remarks on the COVID-19 vaccine, before he joined GETTR on December 29.

Rogan, the host of popular podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” made his first post on GETTR just one minute after he announced his decision on Twitter, [saying](https://gettr.com/post/plg71j5d09), “Just in case shit over at Twitter gets even dumber, I'm here now as well. Rejoice!”

The wave of prominent new GETTR users included [Sen. Ron Johnson](https://gettr.com/user/SenRonJohnson) (R-WI), [Rep. Matt Gaetz](https://gettr.com/user/mattgaetz) (R-FL), the [U.S. House Freedom Caucus](https://gettr.com/user/freedomcaucus), Fox News host [Brian Kilmeade](https://gettr.com/user/kilmeade), conservative leader and former Ohio Secretary of State [Ken Blackwell](https://gettr.com/user/kenblackwell), Trump coronavirus advisor [Dr. Scott Atlas](https://gettr.com/user/ScottWAtlas), and popular YouTuber [KeemStar](https://gettr.com/user/keemstar).

GETTR trended on Twitter in the U.S., U.K., Australia, and Canada during the time period, reaching a peak of number six in the United States on Sunday – the only trending topic in the top 10 that wasn’t related to the National Football League.

GETTR, which does not cancel people for their political opinions, officially launched on July 4th, 2021, achieved its first million users less than three days after launch and cemented its place in history as the fastest growing social media platform ever. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months.
