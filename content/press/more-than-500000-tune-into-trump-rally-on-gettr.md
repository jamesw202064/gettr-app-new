More than half a million people tuned into President Donald Trump’s rally in Georgia on Saturday by logging on to [GETTR](https://gettr.onelink.me/Epfq/e3536848), the new free speech social media platform. The “Save America Rally” in Banks County was ignored by most cable and broadcast news networks, making GETTR the primary location for those wishing to watch the 45th President of the United States.  
   
“We know that the Silicon Valley oligarchs have denied President Trump the opportunity to speak on their social media platforms, just as the ‘news’ networks are refusing to cover his speeches, which means that GETTR is the place to hear from him,” said GETTR Chief Executive Officer Jason Miller. “GETTR is a place where people are free to express their points of view, and you don’t have to be a former president for that to be true.”  
   
Five GETTR accounts carried livestreams of the Trump rally: [Right Side Broadcasting Network](https://gettr.com/user/rsbnetwork), [Right America Media](https://gettr.com/user/ramtv), [Newsmax](https://gettr.com/user/newsmax), [Chase Geiser](https://gettr.com/user/realchasegeiser), and [Real America’s Voice](https://gettr.com/user/realamvoice). They combined to attract 539,400 views.  
   
“This is yet another shot across the bow of the social media giants and the corporate media,” Miller said. “Their days of dominance and controlling access to information are over.”  
   
GETTR is the fastest-growing social media platform in history, having marked its first million users less than three days after its formal launch on July 4, 2021. By comparison, Twitter took 24 months to attract one million users while Facebook took 10 months. Today, GETTR has more than five million registered users.  
   
GETTR is available in the Apple App Store and the Google Play App Store, as well as online at [www.GETTR.com](https://gettr.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=ba369d366bf6ca0ee2e11d0b9&id=d05707d8c7&e=82ee8f8ec6).
